<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>DON RECEIVES A JOLT</h3>
</div>
<p>Before beginning to read the interesting document
in front of him, Jonas Barton, senior
member of Barton &amp; Saltonstall, paused to
clean his glasses rather carefully, in order to
gain sufficient time to study for a moment the
tall, good-looking young man who waited indifferently
on the other side of the desk. He had
not seen his late client&#8217;s son since the latter had
entered college&ndash;&ndash;a black-haired, black-eyed
lad of seventeen, impulsive in manner and
speech. The intervening four years had tempered
him a good deal. Yet, the Pendleton
characteristics were all there&ndash;&ndash;the square jaw,
the rather large, firm mouth, the thin nose, the
keen eyes. They were all there, but each a
trifle subdued: the square jaw not quite so
square as the father&#8217;s, the mouth not quite so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
large, the nose so sharp, or the eyes so keen. On
the other hand, there was a certain fineness that
the father had lacked.</p>
<p>In height Don fairly matched his father&#8217;s six
feet, although he still lacked the Pendleton
breadth of shoulder.</p>
<p>The son was lean, and his cigarette&ndash;&ndash;a
dilettante variation of honest tobacco-smoking
that had always been a source of irritation to
his father&ndash;&ndash;did not look at all out of place
between his long, thin fingers; in fact, nothing
else would have seemed quite suitable. Barton
was also forced to admit to himself that the
young man, in some miraculous way, managed
to triumph over his rather curious choice of
raiment, based presumably on current styles.
In and of themselves the garments were not
beautiful. From Barton&#8217;s point of view, Don&#8217;s
straw hat was too large and too high in the
crown. His black-and-white check suit was too
conspicuous and cut close to the figure in too
feminine a fashion. His lavender socks, which
matched a lavender tie, went well enough with
the light stick he carried; but, in Barton&#8217;s
opinion, a young man of twenty-two had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
business to carry a light stick. By no stretch
of the imagination could one picture the elder
Pendleton in such garb, even in his jauntiest
days. And yet, as worn by Don, it seemed as
if he could not very well have worn anything
else. Even the mourning-band about his left
arm, instead of adding a somber touch, afforded
an effective bit of contrast. This, however, was
no fault of his. That mourning has artistic
possibilities is a happy fact that has brought
gentle solace to many a widow.</p>
<p>On the whole, Barton could not escape the
deduction that the son reflected the present
rather than the past. Try as he might, it was
difficult for him to connect this young man with
Grandfather Pendleton, shipbuilder of New
Bedford, or with the father who in his youth
commanded the Nancy R. But that was by no
means his duty&ndash;&ndash;as Don faintly suggested
when he uncrossed his knees and hitched forward
impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s will is dated three years ago
last June,&#8221; began Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of my freshman year,&#8221; Don
observed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>Jonas Barton adjusted his spectacles and began
to read. He read slowly and very distinctly,
as if anxious to give full value to each syllable:</p>
<p>&#8220;New York City, borough of Manhattan,
State of New York. I, Donald Joshua Pendleton,
being of sound mind and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald Pendleton, Jr., waved an objection
with his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you cut out all the legal stuff and
just give me the gist of it? There&#8217;s no doubt
about father having been of sound mind and
so forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is customary&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began the attorney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll break the custom,&#8221; Don cut in
sharply.</p>
<p>Barton glanced up. It might have been his
late client speaking; it gave him a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;Perhaps, however,
I may be allowed to observe that in many
ways your father&#8217;s will is peculiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be father&#8217;s will if it wasn&#8217;t
peculiar,&#8221; declared Don.</p>
<p>Barton pushed the papers away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Briefly, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your father leaves
his entire estate to you&ndash;&ndash;in trust.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>Don leaned forward, his stick grasped in his
gloved hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get that last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In trust,&#8221; repeated Barton with emphasis.
&#8220;He has honored our firm with the commission
of serving as a board of trustees for carrying out
the terms of the will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to fix my allowance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To carry out the terms of the will, which
are as follows: namely, to turn over to you,
but without power of conveyance, the paternal
domicile on West Sixtieth Street with all its
contents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paternal domicile&ndash;&ndash;I can translate that all
right. I suppose you mean the house. But what&#8217;s
that line &#8216;without power of conveyance&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that you are at liberty to occupy
the premises, but that you are to have no power
to sell, to rent, or to dispose of the property in
any way whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don appeared puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bit queer. What do you suppose
Dad thought I wanted of a place that size to
live in?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think your father was a man of considerable
sentiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sentiment,&#8221; Barton repeated. &#8220;It was
there you were born, and there your mother
died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all correct; but&ndash;&ndash;well, go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of the document, if you insist upon
a digest, consists principally of directions to the
trustees. Briefly, it provides that we invest the
remainder of the property in safe bonds and
apply the interest to meet taxes on the aforesaid
paternal domicile, to retain and pay the wages
of the necessary servants, to furnish fuel and
water, and to maintain the house in proper
repair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In case of your demise&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may skip my demise; I&#8217;m not especially
interested in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think we have covered all the more
important provisions,&#8221; Barton concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;All?&#8221; exclaimed Don. &#8220;What do you think
I&#8217;m going to live on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was the clash for which Barton had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
been waiting. His face hardened, and he
shoved back his chair a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not able to find any provision in the
will relating to that,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? But what the deuce&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Don stared open-mouthed at
the lawyer. Then he reached in his pocket for
his cigarettes, selected one with some deliberation,
and tapped an end upon the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said Dad had considerable sentiment,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;It strikes me he has shown more
humor than sentiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barton was still aggressive. To tell the truth,
he expected some suggestion as to the possibility
of breaking the will; but if ever he had
drawn a paper all snug and tight, it was the one
in question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damme,&#8221; Pendleton, Sr., had said.
&#8220;Damme, Barton, if the lad is able to break
the will, I&#8217;ll rise in my grave and haunt you the
rest of your days.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the boy wished to test the issue, Barton
was ready for him. But the boy&#8217;s thoughts
seemed to be on other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; mused Pendleton, Jr., &#8220;I suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
it was that freshman scrape that worried
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not informed of that,&#8221; replied Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made good reading,&#8221; the young man confided.
&#8220;But, honest, it was not so bad as the
papers made it out. Dad was a good sport
about it, anyhow. He cleared it up and let me
go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will allow me to advance an opinion,&ndash;&ndash;a
strictly personal opinion,&ndash;&ndash;it is that Mr.
Pendleton devised the entire will with nothing
else but your welfare in mind. He had a good
deal of pride, and desired above all things to
have you retain the family home. If I remember
correctly, he said you were the last lineal
descendant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don nodded pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last. Kind of looks as if he wanted me
to remain the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; ventured Barton, &#8220;I
think he hoped you might marry and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry?&#8221; broke in Don. &#8220;Did you say
<i>marry?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I even understood, from a conversation
with your father just before his death, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
you&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;were even then engaged. Am I mistaken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s true enough. But say&ndash;&ndash;look
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man reached in his pocket and
brought forth a handful of crumpled bills and
loose change. He counted it carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve dollars and sixty-three cents,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;What do you think Frances
Stuyvesant will say to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barton refrained from advancing an opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think Morton H. Stuyvesant
will say?&#8221; demanded Don.</p>
<p>No point of law being involved in the query,
Jonas Barton still refrained.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think Mrs. Morton H. Stuyvesant
will say, and all the uncles and aunties
and nephews and nieces?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being their authorized representative,
I am not prepared to answer,&#8221; Barton replied.
&#8220;However, I think I can tell you what your
father would do under these circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; inquired Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would place all the facts in the case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
before the girl, then before her father, and learn
just what they had to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong. He wouldn&#8217;t go beyond the girl,&#8221;
answered Don.</p>
<p>He replaced the change in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he sighed&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;them were the happy
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I remember correctly,&#8221; continued Jonas
Barton thoughtfully, &#8220;twelve dollars and sixty-three
cents was fully as much as your father
possessed when he asked your mother to marry
him. That was just after he lost his ship off
Hatteras.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, them were the happy days,&#8221; nodded
Don. &#8220;But, at that, Dad had his nerve with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; answered Barton. &#8220;He had his
nerve with him always.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EAT</h3>
</div>
<p>In spite of the continued efforts of idealists to
belittle it, there is scarcely a fact of human experience
capable of more universal substantiation
than that in order to live it is necessary to
eat. The corollary is equally true: in order to
eat it is necessary to pay.</p>
<p>Yet until now Pendleton had been in a
position to ignore, if not to refute, the latter
statement. There was probably no detail of his
daily existence calling for less thought or effort
than this matter of dining. Opportunities were
provided on every hand,&ndash;&ndash;at the houses of his
friends, at his club, at innumerable caf&eacute;s and
hotels,&ndash;&ndash;and all that he was asked to contribute
was an appetite.</p>
<p>It was not until he had exhausted his twelve
dollars and sixty-three cents that Don was in
any position to change his point of view. But
that was very soon. After leaving the office of
Barton &amp; Saltonstall at eleven, he took a taxi to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the Harvard Club, which immediately cut down
his capital to ten dollars and thirteen cents.
Here he met friends, Higgins and Watson and
Cabot of his class, and soon he had disposed of
another dollar. They then persuaded him to
walk part way downtown with them. On his
return, he passed a florist&#8217;s, and, remembering
that Frances was going that afternoon to a <i>th&eacute;
dansant</i>, did the decent thing and sent up a
dozen roses, which cost him five dollars.
Shortly after this he passed a confectioner&#8217;s,
and of course had to stop for a box of Frances&#8217;s
favorite bonbons, which cost him another
dollar.</p>
<p>Not that he considered the expense in the
least. As long as he was able to reach in his
pocket and produce a bill of sufficient value to
cover the immediate investment, that was
enough. But it is surprising how brief a while
ten dollars will suffice in a leisurely stroll on
Fifth Avenue. Within a block of the confectionery
store two cravats that took his fancy
and a box of cigarettes called for his last bill,
and actually left him with nothing but a few
odd pieces of silver. Even this did not impress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
him as significant, because, as it happened, his
wants were for the moment fully satisfied.</p>
<p>It was a clear October day, and, quite unconscious
of the distance, Don continued up the
Avenue to Sixtieth Street&ndash;&ndash;to the house where
he was born. In the last ten years he had been
away a good deal from that house,&ndash;&ndash;four years
at Groton, four at Harvard,&ndash;&ndash;but, even so, the
house had always remained in the background
of his consciousness as a fixed point.</p>
<p>Nora opened the door for him, as she had for
twenty years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you to be here for dinner, sir?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Nora,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I shall dine out
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora appeared uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cook, sir, has received a letter&ndash;&ndash;a very
queer sort of letter, sir&ndash;&ndash;from a lawyer gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said she was to keep two accounts, sir:
one for the servants&#8217; table and one for the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s probably from old Barton.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Barton&ndash;&ndash;yes, sir, that was the name. Shall
I bring you the letter, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother, Nora. It&#8217;s all right. He&#8217;s
my new bookkeeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. Then you&#8217;ll give orders for
what you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the library an open fire was burning
brightly on the hearth, as always it had been
kept burning for his father. With his hands
behind his back, he stood before it and gazed
around the big room. It seemed curiously
empty with the old man gone. The machinery
of the house as adjusted by him still continued
to run on smoothly. And yet, where at certain
hours he should have been, he was not. It was
uncanny.</p>
<p>It was a little after one; Don determined to
change his clothes and stroll downtown for
luncheon&ndash;&ndash;possibly at Sherry&#8217;s. He was always
sure there of running across some one he
knew.</p>
<p>He went to his room and dressed with some
care, and then walked down to Forty-fourth
Street. Before deciding to enter the dining-room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
however, he stood at the entrance a moment
to see if there was any one there he recognized.
Jimmy Harndon saw him and rose at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jimmy,&#8221; Don greeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Don. You came in the nick of time.
Lend me ten, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; answered Don.</p>
<p>He sought his bill-book. It was empty. For
a moment he was confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind,&#8221; said Jimmy, perceiving
his embarrassment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8217;phone Dad to send it
up by messenger. Bit of fool carelessness on my
part. You&#8217;ll excuse me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harndon hurried off to the telephone.</p>
<p>Don stared at his empty pocket-book, at the
head waiter, who still stood at the door expectantly,
and then replaced the empty wallet in
his pocket. There was no use waiting here any
longer. He could not dine, if he wished. Never
before in his life had he been confronted by such
a situation. Once or twice he had been in Harndon&#8217;s
predicament, but that had meant no more
to him than it meant to Harndon&ndash;&ndash;nothing
but a temporary embarrassment. The difference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
now was that Harndon could still telephone
his father and that he could not. Here
was a significant distinction; it was something
he must think over.</p>
<p>Don went on to the Harvard Club. He
passed two or three men he knew in the lobby,
but shook his head at their invitation to join
them. He took a seat by himself before an open
fire in a far corner of the lounge. Then he took
out his bill-book again, and examined it with
some care, in the hope that a bill might have
slipped in among his cards. The search was
without result. Automatically his father&#8217;s telephone
number suggested itself, but that number
now was utterly without meaning. A new tenant
already occupied those offices&ndash;&ndash;a tenant
who undoubtedly would report to the police a
modest request to forward to the Harvard Club
by messenger a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>He was beginning to feel hungry&ndash;&ndash;much
hungrier than he would have felt with a pocket
full of money. Of course his credit at the club
was good. He could have gone into the dining-room
and ordered what he wished. But credit
took on a new meaning. Until now it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
nothing but a trifling convenience, because at
the end of the month he had only to forward
his bill to his father. But that could not be done
any longer.</p>
<p>He could also have gone to any one of a
dozen men of his acquaintance and borrowed
from five to fifty dollars. But it was one thing
to borrow as he had in the past, and another to
borrow in his present circumstances. He had no
right to borrow. The whole basis of his credit
was gone.</p>
<p>The situation was, on the face of it, so absurd
that the longer he thought it over the more
convinced he became that Barton had made
some mistake. He decided to telephone Barton.</p>
<p>It was with a sense of relief that Don found
the name of Barton &amp; Saltonstall still in the
telephone-book. It would not have surprised
him greatly if that too had disappeared. It was
with a still greater sense of relief that he finally
heard Barton&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he began. &#8220;It seems to me
there must be some misunderstanding somewhere.
Do you realize that I&#8217;m stony broke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; answered Barton. &#8220;I thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
you showed me the matter of thirteen dollars
or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; but that&#8217;s gone, and all I have now is
the matter of thirteen cents or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; answered Barton. &#8220;If a small
loan would be of any temporary advantage&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; cut in Don. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m trying to borrow, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. Perhaps you will tell
me, then, just what you do wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must eat, mustn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider that a fair presumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what the deuce!&#8221;</p>
<p>Don evidently expected this ejaculation to be
accepted as a full and conclusive statement.
But, as far as Barton was concerned, it was not.
&#8220;Yes?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, what the deuce?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. You mean, I take it, what must
you do in order to provide yourself with funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; growled Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the usual method is to work,&#8221;
suggested Barton.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To find a position with some firm which, in
return for your services, is willing to pay you a
certain fixed sum weekly or monthly. I offer
you the suggestion for what it is worth. You
can think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it over!&#8221; exclaimed Don. &#8220;How long
do you think I can think on thirteen cents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you authorize me to act for you, I have
no doubt something can be arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to hold all the cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am merely obeying your father&#8217;s commands,&#8221;
Barton hastened to assure him. &#8220;Now,
can you give me any idea what you have in
mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything except sell books,&#8221; Don
answered promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; concluded Barton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll advise
you by mail as soon as anything develops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the mean while, if you will accept a
loan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks again,&#8221; answered Don; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll go
hungry first.&#8221; He hung up the receiver and
went back to the lounge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE QUEEN WAS IN THE PARLOR</h3>
</div>
<p>Stuyvesant was proud of his daughter&ndash;&ndash;proud
of her beauty, proud of her ability to
dress, proud of her ability to spend money. She
gave him about the only excuse he now had for
continuing to hold his seat on the Stock Exchange.
The girl was tall and dark and slender,
and had an instinct for clothes that permitted
her to follow the vagaries of fashion to their
extremes with the assurance of a Parisienne,
plus a certain Stuyvesant daring that was
American. At dinner that night she wore, for
Don&#8217;s benefit, a new French gown that made
even him catch his breath. It was beautiful,
but without her it would not have been beautiful.
Undoubtedly its designer took that into
account when he designed the gown.</p>
<p>The dinner was in every way a success, and a
credit to the Stuyvesant chef&ndash;&ndash;who, however,
it must be said, seldom had the advantage of
catering to a guest that had not lunched. Stuyvesant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
was in a good humor, Mrs. Stuyvesant
pleasantly negative as usual, and Frances radiant.
Early in the evening Stuyvesant went off
to his club for a game of bridge, and Mrs.
Stuyvesant excused herself to write notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met Reggie Howland at the tea this afternoon,&#8221;
said Frances. &#8220;He was very nice to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he be?&#8221; inquired Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather thought you would come. Really,
when one goes to all the bother of allowing one&#8217;s
self to be engaged, the least one expects is a
certain amount of attention from one&#8217;s fianc&eacute;e.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was standing by the piano, and he went
to her side and took her hand&ndash;&ndash;the hand wearing
the solitaire that had been his mother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he nodded; &#8220;but I was all
tied up with business this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her dark brows a trifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of it,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;Come over here
and sit down; I want to tell you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led her to a chair before the open fire. He
himself continued to stand with his back to
the flames. He was not serious. The situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
struck him now as even funnier than it had in
Barton&#8217;s office. He had in his pocket just thirteen
cents, and yet here he was in Stuyvesant&#8217;s
house, engaged to Stuyvesant&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems,&#8221; he began&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it seems that Dad
would have his little joke before he died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she responded indifferently. She was
bored by business of any sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a talk to-day with Barton&ndash;&ndash;his
lawyer. Queer old codger, Barton. Seems he&#8217;s
been made my guardian. Dad left him to me in
his will. He left me Barton, the house, and
twelve dollars and sixty-three cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not quite understand why he was
going into details. They did not seem to concern
her, even as his fianc&eacute;e.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of that patrimony I now have thirteen
cents left,&#8221; Don continued. &#8220;See, here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He removed from his pocket two nickels and
three coppers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like much, does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;do be serious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am serious,&#8221; he assured her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
serious ever since I went to Sherry&#8217;s for lunch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
and found I did not have enough for even a club
sandwich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Don!&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact. I had to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where <i>did</i> you lunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you did not have enough change
to buy something to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thirteen cents. You can&#8217;t buy anything
with that, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered how, once on her
way home from Chicago, she lost her purse and
did not have sufficient change left even to wire
her father to meet her. She was forced to walk
from the station to the house. The experience
had always been like a nightmare to her. She
rose and stood before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Don&ndash;&ndash;what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I telephoned Barton, and he suggested I
take some sort of position with a business house.
He&#8217;s going to find something for me. I&#8217;m not
worrying about that; but what I want to know
is what I ought to do about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand, Don.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I mean about our engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m very stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be married on thirteen cents, can
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we needn&#8217;t be married until you have
more, need we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. And you&#8217;re willing to wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ve told you I didn&#8217;t wish to
be married before spring, anyway. I think it&#8217;s
much pleasanter staying just as we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be engaged all our lives,&#8221; he
protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be engaged as long as we wish,
can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to marry you as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes brightened and she placed a soft
hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice of you, Don,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
you don&#8217;t know what a frightfully expensive
burden I&#8217;ll be as a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I earned, to start with, say fifty dollars a
week&ndash;&ndash;would you marry me on that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did, what would we live on?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have the house. That&#8217;s provided
for&ndash;&ndash;all except the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I spent the fifty dollars for a new hat,
then what would we have left for provisions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t spend it all on a new hat,&#8221; he
warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, there are gowns and&ndash;&ndash;oh, lots of
things you don&#8217;t know anything about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you get along with a little less?&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how,&#8221; she decided. &#8220;I never get
anything I don&#8217;t want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; he nodded approvingly.
&#8220;Then you think I must earn more than
fifty a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know that Dad gives me an allowance
of ten thousand a year, and there&#8217;s never
anything left,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten thousand a year!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is so expensive to-day, Don.
All this talk sounds frightfully vulgar, but&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
no use pretending, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;If ten thousand
a year is what you need, ten thousand a year
is what I must earn.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s very hard, because Dad
does it so easily,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; he nodded confidently. &#8220;And,
now that it&#8217;s all settled, let&#8217;s forget it. Come
over to the piano and sing for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down before the keys and played her
accompaniments, selecting his own songs.
They ran through some of the latest opera successes,
and then swung off to the simpler and
older things. It was after &#8220;Annie Laurie&#8221; that
he rose and looked deep into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it for you,&#8221; he said soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Sometimes
nothing seems important but just you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING SANDWICHES</h3>
</div>
<p>The arrangement that Barton made for his
late client&#8217;s son was to enter the banking house
of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves, on a salary of
twelve hundred dollars a year. Don found the
letter at the Harvard Club the next morning,
and immediately telephoned Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I appreciate
what you&#8217;ve tried to do and all that, but what
in thunder good is twelve hundred dollars a
year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is at least twelve hundred more than you
have now,&#8221; suggested Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can I live on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must remember you have the house&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the house,&#8221; Don interrupted. &#8220;I
must eat and smoke and buy clothes, mustn&#8217;t
I? Besides, there&#8217;s Frances. She needs ten
thousand a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt but that, in time, a man of
your ability&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How long a time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As to that I am not prepared to give an
opinion,&#8221; replied Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it isn&#8217;t when I&#8217;m eighty that I
want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say the matter was entirely in your
own hands. This at least offers you an opening,
and I advise you to accept it. However, you
must decide for yourself; and if at any later date
I may be of service&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don returned to the lounge to think the
matter over. It was ten o&#8217;clock and he had not
yet breakfasted. As he had neglected to send
any provisions to the house, Nora, acting upon
his orders of the day before, had not prepared
anything for him&ndash;&ndash;there was nothing to prepare.</p>
<p>However, whether he ate breakfast or not
was a detail. That is to say, it was a detail when
he left the house; but now, after the brisk walk
to the club in the snapping cold air, it had
grown in importance. Watson, on his way into
the dining-room, passed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Join me?&#8221; he asked, waving a greeting
with the morning paper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; answered Don. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll wait
a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson went on.</p>
<p>Don returned to a consideration of Barton&#8217;s
proposal. He was forced to admit that the old
lawyer had an irritating knack of ignoring all
incidental issues and stripping a problem to a
statement of irrefutable fact. It was undeniable,
for example, that what Don might desire in the
way of salary did not affect the truth of Barton&#8217;s
contention that twelve hundred dollars
was a great deal more than nothing. With a
roof over his head assured him, it was possible
that he might, with economy, be able at least to
keep alive on this salary. That, of course, was
a matter to be considered. As for Frances, she
was at present well provided for and need not
be in the slightest affected by the smallness of
his income. Then, there was the possibility of
a rapid advance. He had no idea how those
things were arranged, but his limited observation
was to the effect that his friends who went
into business invariably had all the money they
needed, and that most of his older acquaintances&ndash;&ndash;friends
of his father&ndash;&ndash;were presidents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
and vice-presidents with unlimited bank accounts.
Considering these facts, Don grew
decidedly optimistic.</p>
<p>In the mean time his hunger continued to
press him. His body, like a greedy child, demanded
food. Watson came out and, lighting a
fresh cigarette, sank down comfortably into a
chair next him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Don&ndash;&ndash;off your feed?&#8221;
he inquired casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something of the sort,&#8221; nodded Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Party last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; guess I haven&#8217;t been getting exercise
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose. Somehow, Watson bored him this
morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a hike down the Avenue.
S&#8217;long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don secured his hat, gloves, and stick, and
started from the club at a brisk clip.</p>
<p>From Forty-fourth Street to the Twenties
was as familiar a path as any in his life. He had
traversed it probably a thousand times. Yet, this
morning it suddenly became almost as strange
as some street in Kansas City or San Francisco.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>There were three reasons for this, any one of
which would have accounted for the phenomenon:
he was on his way to secure a job; he had
in his pocket just thirteen cents; and he was
hungry.</p>
<p>The stores before which he always stopped
for a leisurely inspection of their contents took
on a different air this morning. Quite automatically
he paused before one and another of
them and inspected the day&#8217;s display of cravats
and waistcoats. But, with only thirteen cents
in his pocket, a new element entered into his
consideration of these things&ndash;&ndash;the element of
cost. It was at the florist&#8217;s that his situation
was brought home to him even more keenly.
Frances liked flowers, and she liked to receive
them from him. Here were roses that looked
as if they had been plucked for her. But they
were behind a big plate-glass window. He
had never noted before that, besides being
transparent, plate-glass was also thick and
hard. And he was hungry. The fact continually
intruded itself.</p>
<p>At last he reached the address that Barton
had given him. &#8220;Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Investment Securities,&#8221; read the inscription on
the window. He passed through the revolving
doors and entered the office.</p>
<p>A boy in buttons approached and took his
card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Carter, Mr. Rand, or Mr. Seagraves,&#8221;
said Don.</p>
<p>The boy was soon back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Farnsworth will see you in a few
minutes,&#8221; he reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farnsworth?&#8221; inquired Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the gent what sees every one,&#8221; explained
the boy. &#8220;Ticker&#8217;s over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to a small machine upon a stand,
which was slowly unfurling from its mouth a
long strip of paper such as prestidigitators produce
from silk hats. Don crossed to it, and
studied the strip with interest. It was spattered
with cryptic letters and figures, much like those
he had learned to use indifferently well in a
freshman course in chemistry. The only ones he
recalled just then were
H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>,
and he amused himself by watching to see if they
turned up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Pendleton?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Don turned to find a middle-aged gentleman
standing before him with outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barton wrote to us about you,&#8221; Farnsworth
continued briskly. &#8220;I believe he said you
had no business experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harvard man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don named his class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father was well known to us. We are
willing to take you on for a few months, if you
wish to try the work. Of course, until you learn
something of the business you won&#8217;t be of much
value; but if you&#8217;d like to start at&ndash;&ndash;say
twenty-five dollars a week&ndash;&ndash;why, we&#8217;d be
glad to have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the beginning Don had a vague notion of
estimating his value at considerably more; but
Mr. Farnsworth was so decided, it did not seem
worth while. At that moment, also, he was
reminded again that he had not yet breakfasted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;When shall I begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you wish. If you haven&#8217;t anything
on to-day, you might come in now, meet
some of the men, and get your bearings.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Don.</p>
<p>Within the next five minutes Farnsworth had
introduced him to Blake and Manson and
Wheaton and Powers and Jennings and Chandler.
Also to Miss Winthrop, a very busy stenographer.
Then he left him in a chair by Powers&#8217;s
desk. Powers was dictating to Miss Winthrop,
and Don became engrossed in watching the
nimbleness of her fingers.</p>
<p>At the end of his dictation, Powers excused
himself and went out, leaving Don alone with
Miss Winthrop. For a moment he felt a bit uncomfortable;
he was not quite sure what the
etiquette of a business office demanded in a situation
of this sort. Soon, however, he realized
that the question was solving itself by the fact
that Miss Winthrop was apparently oblivious
to his presence. If he figured in her consciousness
any more than one of the office chairs, she
gave no indication of it. She was transcribing
from her notebook to the typewriter, and her
fingers moved with marvelous dexterity and
sureness. There was a sureness about every
other movement, as when she slipped in a new
sheet of paper or addressed an envelope or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
raised her head. There was a sureness in her
eyes. He found himself quite unexpectedly staring
into them once, and they didn&#8217;t waver,
although he was not quite certain, even then,
that they saw him. They were brown eyes,
honest and direct, above a good nose and a
mouth that, while retaining its girlish mobility,
also revealed an unexpected trace of almost
manlike firmness. It was a face that interested
him, but, before he was able to determine in
just what way, she finished her last letter
and, rising abruptly, disappeared into a rear
room. Presently she emerged, wearing a hat
and coat.</p>
<p>It was, on the whole, a very becoming hat and
a very becoming coat, though they would not
have suited at all the critical taste of Frances
Stuyvesant. But they had not been designed
for that purpose.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop paused to readjust a pin and
the angle of her hat. Then she took a swift
glance about the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the boys must have gone,&#8221; she said
to Don. &#8220;This is the lunch hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don rose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for letting me know,&#8221; he replied
cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them get back at one,&#8221; she informed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think I may go out until then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not. But I&#8217;d be back at one
sharp if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don gave her an opportunity to go out the
door and disappear before he himself followed.
He had a notion that she could have told him,
had he asked, where in this neighborhood it was
possible to get the most food for the least
money. He had a notion, also, that such a
question would not have shocked her. It was
difficult to say by just what process he reached
this conclusion, but he felt quite sure of it.</p>
<p>Don was now firmly determined to invest a
portion of his thirteen cents in something to eat.
It had no longer become a matter of volition,
but an acute necessity. For twenty minutes he
wandered about rather aimlessly; then, in a
sort of alley, he found a dairy lunch where in
plain figures coffee was offered at five cents a
cup, and egg sandwiches at the same price. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
place was well filled, but he was fortunate in
slipping into a chair against the wall just as a
man was slipping out. It was a chair where one
broad arm served as a table. Next to him sat
a young woman in a black hat, munching a
chocolate &eacute;clair. She looked up as he sat
down, and frowned. Don rose at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you
were here. Honest I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a public lunch, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she
inquired. &#8220;I&#8217;m almost through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t mind if I stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no business of mine,&#8221; she said curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to think I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
intruding.&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced at him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s forget it,&#8221; she decided. &#8220;But you
might sit there all day and you wouldn&#8217;t get
anything to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around, uncertain as to just what
she meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to the counter, pick out what you
want, and bring it back here,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold your seat for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don made his way into the crowd at the rear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
At the counter he found he had for ten cents a
wide choice; but her &eacute;clair had looked so good
he selected one of those and a cup of coffee. In
returning he lost a portion of the coffee, but he
brought the &eacute;clair through safely. He deposited
it on the arm of the chair and sat down. In spite
of his utmost effort at self-control, that &eacute;clair
made just four mouthfuls. It seemed to him
that he had no more than picked up his fork
than it was gone. However, he still had his
coffee, and he settled back to enjoy that in a
more temperate fashion.</p>
<p>Without apparently taking the slightest interest
in him, Miss Winthrop observed the
rapidity with which he concluded his lunch.
She knew something about being hungry, and
if she was any judge that tidbit produced no
more impression upon this six-foot man than a
peanut on an elephant.</p>
<p>&#8220;That all you&#8217;re going to eat?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>Don was startled. The question was both
unexpected and pointed. He met her eyes&ndash;&ndash;brown
eyes and very direct. The conventional
explanation that he had ready about not caring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
for much in the middle of the day seemed
scarcely worth while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broke?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to have had an egg sandwich
instead of one of those things,&#8221; she informed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the one you had looked so good,&#8221; he
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an egg sandwich to start with; this
was dessert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to get one now. You won&#8217;t last
until night on just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much are they?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nickel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess I won&#8217;t have one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you five cents?&#8221; she cross-examined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only three cents,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you begin work to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Tuesday, and you won&#8217;t get paid
until Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect to make that &eacute;clair go until
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought much about it,&#8221; he answered
uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look as if you would,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You are new to this, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not resent her questioning; and it did
not occur to him to give her an evasive reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just out of college?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you been doing since then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, nothing,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;You see,
my father died only last month, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; she said more gently. &#8220;That&#8217;s
hard luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes a good deal of a difference,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had made a difference in her life when her
father died.</p>
<p>She turned to her &eacute;clair; but, as she was raising
the fork to her lips, she caught his eyes and
put it down again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you must eat something.
You can&#8217;t get along without food. I&#8217;ve
tried it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dieting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; she replied grimly.</p>
<p>He had heard of men going perforce without
food, but he did not remember ever having
heard of a woman in that predicament. Certainly
he had never before met one.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that you&#8217;ve gone broke, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;The firm
I was with first went broke, and it was a couple
of months before I found another position.
But that&#8217;s over now. What I want to know is
what <i>you&#8217;re</i> going to do until Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll worry along,&#8221; he answered confidently.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worry won&#8217;t carry you along.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then said
impulsively:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t get peeved at what
I&#8217;m going to say, will you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible to get peeved
with you,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it go at that. What I want to do is
to lend you a couple of dollars until Saturday.
It isn&#8217;t much, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don caught his breath. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not give him time to finish. From
somewhere she produced a two-dollar bill and
slipped it into his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this and get an egg sandwich right
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk. Go get a sandwich.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed to have no alternative; but when
he came back with it she had disappeared.</p>
<p>He sat down, but he could not understand
why she should have gone like that. He missed
her&ndash;&ndash;missed her more than he would have
thought possible, considering that he had met
her only some two hours before. Without her
this place seemed empty and foreign. Without
her he felt uneasy here. He hurried through his
sandwich and went out&ndash;&ndash;anxious to get back
to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>BUSINESS</h3>
</div>
<p>When Don came back to the office he found
Miss Winthrop again at her typewriter, but she
did not even glance up as he took his former
place at Powers&#8217;s desk. If this was not particularly
flattering, it at least gave him the privilege
of watching her. But it was rather curious that
he found in this enough to hold his attention for
half an hour. It is doubtful whether he could
have watched Frances herself for so long a time
without being bored.</p>
<p>It was the touch of seriousness about the
girl&#8217;s eyes and mouth that now set him to wondering&ndash;&ndash;a
seriousness that he had sometimes
noted in the faces of men who had seen much
of life.</p>
<p>Life&ndash;&ndash;that was the keynote. He felt that
she had been in touch with life, and had got the
better of it: that there had been drama in her
past, born of contact with men and women.
She had been dealing with such problems as securing
food&ndash;&ndash;and his experience of the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
twenty-four hours had hinted at how dramatic
that may be; with securing lodgings for the
night; with the problem of earning not more
money but enough money to keep her alive.
All this had left its mark, not in ugliness, but
in a certain seriousness that made him keen
to know about her. Here was a girl who was
not especially concerned with operas, with
books, with the drama, but with the stuff of
which those things are made.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop removed from her typewriter
the final page of the long letter she had finished
and rapidly went over it for errors. She found
none. But, as she gathered her papers together
before taking them into the private office of Mr.
Farnsworth, she spoke. She spoke without even
then glancing at Don&ndash;&ndash;as if voicing a thought
to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they are not going
to pay you for sitting there and watching me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don felt the color spring to his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me any,&#8221; she continued,
as she rose. &#8220;Only there isn&#8217;t any money for
the firm in that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything
around here for me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then make something,&#8221; she concluded, as
she moved away.</p>
<p>Blake, to whom he had been introduced, was
sitting at his desk reading an early edition of an
evening paper. Spurred on by her admonition,
he strolled over there. Blake glanced up with a
nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you making it?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much for me to
do,&#8221; said Don. &#8220;Can you suggest anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farnsworth will dig up enough for you later
on. I wouldn&#8217;t worry about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know anything about the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pick it up. Did I understand Farnsworth
to say you were Harvard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Princeton. Say, what sort of a football
team have you this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don knew football. He had played right end
on the second team. He also knew Princeton,
and if the information he gave Blake about the
team ever went back to New Jersey it did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
do the coaching staff there any good. However,
it furnished a subject for a pleasant half hour&#8217;s
conversation. Then Blake went out, and Don
returned to his former place back of Powers&#8217;s
desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t get much out of him,&#8221;
observed Miss Winthrop, without interrupting
the click of her machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems rather a decent sort,&#8221; answered
Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a Princeton man,&#8221; Don informed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Percy A. Blake,&#8221; she declared&ndash;&ndash;as if
that were a fact of considerably more importance.</p>
<p>He waited to see if she was ready to volunteer
any further information, but apparently
she considered this sufficient.</p>
<p>At that point Farnsworth came out and took
a look about the office. His eyes fell upon Don,
and he crossed the room.</p>
<p>He handed Don a package.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would deliver these to Mr.
Hayden, of Hayden &amp; Wigglesworth,&#8221; he requested.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>Farnsworth returned to his office, leaving
Don staring helplessly at the package in his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, get busy!&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where can I find Mr. Hayden?&#8221;
inquired Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the office and look up the firm in
a directory,&#8221; she returned sharply. &#8220;But hustle
out of here just as if you did know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don seized his hat and obeyed. He found
himself on the street, quite as ignorant of where
to find a directory as he was of where to find
Mr. Hayden, of Hayden &amp; Wigglesworth. But
in rounding a corner&ndash;&ndash;still at full speed&ndash;&ndash;he
ran into a messenger boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to the office of Hayden &amp; Wigglesworth
and there&#8217;s a quarter in it for you,&#8221; he
offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on,&#8221; nodded the boy.</p>
<p>The office was less than a five minutes&#8217; walk
away. In another two minutes Don had left
his package with Mr. Hayden&#8217;s clerk and was
back again in his own office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snappy work,&#8221; Miss Winthrop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
complimented him. &#8220;The closing prices must be out
by now. You&#8217;d better look them over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Closing prices of what?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market, of course. Ask Eddie&ndash;&ndash;the
boy at the ticker. He&#8217;ll give you a sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Don went over and asked Eddie, and was
handed a list of closing quotations&ndash;&ndash;which, for
all he was concerned, might have been football
signals. However, he sat down and looked them
over, and continued to look them over until
Farnsworth passed him on his way home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well go now,&#8221; Farnsworth
said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be here at nine to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine to-morrow,&#8221; nodded Don.</p>
<p>He returned to Miss Winthrop&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says I may go now,&#8221; he reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d go,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;I want to thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t!&#8221; she exploded.
&#8220;I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the Subway back to the Grand
Central, and walked from there to the club.
Here he found a message from Frances:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Dad sent up a box for the theater to-night.
Will you come to dinner and go with us?</p>
<p>When Don, after dressing, left his house for
the Stuyvesants&#8217; that evening, it was with a
curious sense of self-importance. He now had
the privilege of announcing to his friends that
he was in business in New York&ndash;&ndash;in the banking
business&ndash;&ndash;with Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves,
as a matter of fact. He walked with a freer
stride and swung his stick with a jauntier air
than he had yesterday.</p>
<p>He was full of this when, a few minutes before
dinner, Frances swept down the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you could come, Don,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But where in the world have you been all
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Downtown,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made the announcement with considerable
pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Don!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;But, if you&#8217;re
going to do that sort of thing, I suppose you
might as well be with them as any one. I wonder
if that Seagraves is Dolly Seagraves&#8217;s
father.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>For a second he was disappointed&ndash;&ndash;he had
expected more enthusiasm from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t met the families of the firm
yet,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you knew Dolly. I&#8217;ll ask her up
for my next afternoon, to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t come in the afternoon, Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid! You&#8217;re to be downtown all
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From nine to three or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m going to like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to speak to Farnsworth,&#8221;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farnsworth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine he&#8217;s very disagreeable. Oh, Don,
please hurry and make your fortune and have
it over with!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to give me more than one day,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you till June,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I really
got sort of homesick for you to-day, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, Don. I&#8217;ve no business to tell you
such a secret, but it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you told me,&#8221; he answered
soberly. &#8220;What have you been doing all
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a stupid morning at the tailor&#8217;s, and a
stupid bridge in the afternoon at the Martins&#8217;.
Oh, I lost a disgraceful lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I won&#8217;t tell; but that&#8217;s
why I told Dad he must take me to see something
cheerful this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tough luck,&#8221; he sympathized.</p>
<p>They went in to dinner. Afterward the
Stuyvesant car took them all to a vaudeville
house, and there, from the rear of a box, Don
watched with indifferent interest the usual
vaudeville turns. To tell the truth, he would
have been better satisfied to have sat at the
piano at home and had Frances sing to him.
There were many things he had wished to talk
over with her. He had not told her about the
other men he had met, his adventure on his first
business assignment, his search for a place to
lunch, or&ndash;&ndash;Miss Winthrop. Until that moment
he had not thought of her himself.</p>
<p>A singing team made their appearance and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
began to sing sentimental ballads concerned
with apple blossoms in Normandy. Don&#8217;s
thoughts went back, strangely enough, to the
white-tiled restaurant in the alley. He smiled
as he contrived a possible title for a popular
song of this same nature. &#8220;The White-Tiled
Restaurant in the Alley&#8221; it might read, and it
might have something to do with &#8220;Sally.&#8221; Perhaps
Miss Winthrop&#8217;s first name was Sally&ndash;&ndash;it
fitted her well enough. She had been funny
about that chocolate &eacute;clair. And she had lent
him two dollars. Unusual incident, that! He
wondered where she was to-night&ndash;&ndash;where she
went after she left the office at night. Perhaps
she was here. He leaned forward to look at the
faces of people in the audience. Then the singing
stopped, and a group of Japanese acrobats
occupied the stage.</p>
<p>Frances turned, suppressing a yawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose one of them will hang by his
teeth in a minute,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;I wish he
wouldn&#8217;t. It makes me ache.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always possible to leave,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mother so enjoys the pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, by all means, let&#8217;s stay.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They always put them at the end. Oh,
dear me, I don&#8217;t think I shall ever come
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoyed the singing,&#8221; he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don, it was horrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, that song about the restaurant in the
alley&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>what?</i>&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it that or was it apple blossoms?
Anyhow, it was good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there&#8217;s no great difference between
restaurants in alleys and apple blossoms
in Normandy!&#8221; she commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so much as you&#8217;d think,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>It was eleven before they were back at the
house. Then Stuyvesant wanted a rarebit and
Frances made it, so that it was after one before
Don reached his own home.</p>
<p>Not until Nora, in obedience to a note he had
left downstairs for her, called him at seven-thirty
the next morning did Don realize he had
kept rather late hours for a business man. Bit
by bit, the events of yesterday came back to
him; and in the midst of it, quite the central
figure, stood Miss Winthrop. It was as if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
were warning him not to be late. He jumped
from bed.</p>
<p>But, even at that, it was a quarter-past eight
before he came downstairs. Nora was anxiously
waiting for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not order breakfast, sir,&#8221; she
reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I prepare it for you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. I haven&#8217;t time to wait, anyway.
You see, I must be downtown at nine.
I&#8217;m in business, Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; but you should eat your breakfast,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try going
without breakfast this week. Besides, I didn&#8217;t
send up any provisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora appeared uneasy. She did not wish to
be bold, and yet she did not wish her late master&#8217;s
son to go downtown hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;An egg and a bit of toast, sir? I&#8217;m sure the
cook could spare that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of her own breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; stammered
Nora; &#8220;but it&#8217;s all part of the house, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered firmly. &#8220;We must play
the game fair, Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And dinner, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner? Let&#8217;s not worry about that as
early in the morning as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started to leave, but at the door turned
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you should want me during the day,
you&#8217;ll find me at my office with Carter, Rand &amp;
Seagraves. Better write that down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day, Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don took the Subway this morning, in company
with several hundred thousand others for
whom this was as much a routine part of their
daily lives as the putting on of a hat. He had
seen all these people coming and going often
enough before, but never before had he felt
himself as coming and going with them. Now
he was one of them. He did not resent it. In
fact, he felt a certain excitement about it. But
it was new&ndash;&ndash;almost foreign.</p>
<p>It was with some difficulty that he found his
way from the station to his office. This so delayed
him that he was twenty minutes late.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Miss Winthrop, who was hard at work when he
entered, paused a second to glance at the watch
pinned to her dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only twenty minutes late,&#8221; he apologized
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good many things can happen around
Wall Street in twenty minutes,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to leave the house a little
earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do something to get here on time,&#8221; she
advised. &#8220;Out late last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very. I was in bed a little after one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She brought the conversation to an abrupt
end by resuming her work.</p>
<p>He wanted to ask her in just what way he
looked it. He felt a bit hollow; but that was because
he hadn&#8217;t breakfasted. His eyes, too,
were still a little heavy; but that was the result,
not of getting to bed late, but of getting up too
early.</p>
<p>She, on the other hand, appeared fresher
than she had yesterday at noon. Her eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
brighter and there was more color in her cheeks.
Don had never seen much of women in the forenoon.
As far as he was concerned, Frances did
not exist before luncheon. But what experience
he had led him to believe that Miss Winthrop
was an exception&ndash;&ndash;that most women continued
to freshen toward night and were at their
best at dinner-time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Pendleton.&#8221; It was Eddie. &#8220;Mr.
Farnsworth wants to see you in his office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farnsworth handed Don a collection of circulars
describing some of the securities the firm
was offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better familiarize yourself with these,&#8221; he
said briefly. &#8220;If there is anything in them you
don&#8217;t understand, ask one of the other men.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. In less than three minutes Don
was back again at Powers&#8217;s desk. He glanced
through one of the circulars, which had to do
with a certain electric company offering gold
bonds at a price to net four and a half. He read
it through once and then read it through again.
It contained a great many figures&ndash;&ndash;figures
running into the millions, whose effect was to
make twenty-five dollars a week shrink into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
insignificance. On the whole, it was decidedly
depressing reading&ndash;&ndash;the more so because he
did not understand it.</p>
<p>He wondered what Miss Winthrop did when
she was tired, where she lived and how she
lived, if she played bridge, if she spent her summers
abroad, who her parents were, whether she
was eighteen or twenty-two or -three, and if she
sang. All of which had nothing to do with the
affairs of the company that wished to dispose of
its gold bonds at a price to net four and a half.</p>
<p>At twelve Miss Winthrop rose from her machine
and sought her hat in the rear of the office.
At twelve-five she came back, passed him as if
he had been an empty chair, and went out the
door. At twelve-ten he followed. He made his
way at once to the restaurant in the alley. She
was not in the chair she had occupied yesterday,
but farther back. Happily, the chair next to her
was empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you hold this for me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better drop your hat in it,&#8221; she suggested
rather coldly.</p>
<p>He obeyed the suggestion, and a minute later
returned with a cup of coffee and an egg sandwich.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
She was gazing indifferently across the
room as he sat down, but he called her attention
to his lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I got one of these things to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you eat it with a fork or pick it up in
your fingers?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She turned involuntarily to see if he was
serious. She could not tell, but it was a fact
he looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pick it up in your fingers,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;But look here; are you coming here
every day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, if you are, I&#8217;m going to find another
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find another place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sandwich was halfway to his lips. He
put it down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I done?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>She was avoiding his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But if
the office ever found out&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It would make a lot of talk, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; she
concluded quickly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom would they talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they wouldn&#8217;t talk about you&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They would talk about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it over,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The thing
you want to remember is that I&#8217;m only a stenographer
there, and you&ndash;&ndash;well, if you make
good you&#8217;ll be a member of the firm some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what that has to do with where
you eat or where I eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t, as long as we don&#8217;t eat at the
same place. Can&#8217;t you see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes and met his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see now,&#8221; he answered soberly. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
think I&#8217;m getting fresh with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m letting you get fresh,&#8221;
she answered, lowering her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t think that yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered slowly. &#8220;I
used to think I could tell; but now&ndash;&ndash;oh, I
don&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But good Heavens! you&#8217;ve been a regular
little trump to me. You&#8217;ve even lent me the
money to buy my lunches with. Do you think
any man could be so low down&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those things aren&#8217;t fit to eat when they&#8217;re
cold,&#8221; she warned him.</p>
<p>He shoved his plate aside and leaned toward
her. &#8220;Do you think&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Only, it
isn&#8217;t what <i>I</i> think that matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing in this case that does
matter,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait until you know Blake,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if any one is to quit here, it is I,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stay where you are,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;I know a lot of other places just
like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can find them, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed&ndash;&ndash;a contagious little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think much of my ability, do
you?&#8221; he returned, somewhat nettled.</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes at that.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If you want to know the truth,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I do. And I&#8217;ve seen a lot of &#8217;em come and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reacted curiously to this unexpected
praise. His color heightened and unconsciously
he squared his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then you ought to
trust me to be able to find another lunch-place.
Besides, you forget I found this myself. Are
you going to have an &eacute;clair to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded and started to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit still; I&#8217;ll get it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she could protest he was halfway to
the counter. She sat back in her chair with an
expression that was half-frown and half-smile.</p>
<p>When he came back she slipped a nickel upon
the arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this for?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the &eacute;clair, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you needn&#8217;t have done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay my own way, thank you,&#8221; she
answered, her face hardening a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re offended again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; only&ndash;&ndash;oh, can&#8217;t you see we&ndash;&ndash;I must
find another place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then that proves it,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;And
now I&#8217;m going back to the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose at once to go with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please to sit right where you are for five
minutes,&#8221; she begged.</p>
<p>He sat down again and watched her as she
hurried out the door. The moment she disappeared
the place seemed curiously empty&ndash;&ndash;curiously
empty and inane. He stared at the
white-tiled walls, at the heaps of pastry upon
the marble counter, prepared as for wholesale.
Yet, as long as she sat here with him, he had
noticed none of those details. For all he was
conscious of his surroundings, they might have
been lunching together in that subdued, pink-tinted
room where he so often took Frances.</p>
<p>He started as he thought of her. Then he
smiled contentedly. He must have Frances to
lunch with him in the pink-tinted dining-room
next Saturday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TWO GIRLS</h3>
</div>
<p>That night, when Miss Winthrop took her
place in the Elevated on her way to the uptown
room that made her home, she dropped her
evening paper in her lap, and, chin in hand,
stared out of the window. That was decidedly
unusual. It was so unusual that a young man
who had taken this same train with her month
after month, and who had rather a keen eye for
such things, noticed for the first time that she
had in profile rather an attractive face. She
was wondering just how different this Pendleton
was from the other men she met. Putting
aside for a moment all generalizations affecting
the sex as a whole, he was not like any of them.
For the first time in a long while she found herself
inclined to accept a man for just what he
appeared to be. It was difficult not to believe in
Pendleton&#8217;s eyes, and still more difficult not to
believe in his smile, which made her smile back.
And yet, if she had learned anything, those were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
the very things in a man she had learned to
question.</p>
<p>Not that she was naturally cynical, but her
downtown experience had left her very skeptical
about her ability to judge men from such
details. Blake, for instance, could smile as innocently
as a child and meet any woman&#8217;s eyes
without flinching. But there was this difference
between Blake and Pendleton: the latter was
new to New York. He was fresh to the city, as
four years ago she had been. In those days she
had dreamed of such a man as Pendleton&ndash;&ndash;a
dream that she was sure she had long since forgotten.
Four years was a long while. It gave
her rather a motherly feeling as she thought of
Pendleton from that distance. And she rather
enjoyed that. It left her freer to continue thinking
of him. This she did until she was almost
carried beyond her street.</p>
<p>After that she almost forgot to stop at
the delicatessen store for her rolls and butter
and cold meat. She hurried with them to her
room&ndash;&ndash;hurried because she was anxious to
reach the place where she was more at liberty
than anywhere else on earth. She tossed aside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
her hat and coat and sat by the radiator to
warm her hands.</p>
<p>She wondered if Pendleton would go the
same way Blake had gone. It was so very easy
to go the one way or the other. Farnsworth
himself never helped. His theory was to allow
new men to work out their own salvation, and
to fire them if they did not. He had done that
with young Brown, who came in last year; and
it had seemed to her then a pity&ndash;&ndash;though she
had never liked Brown. This was undoubtedly
what he would do with Pendleton.</p>
<p>But supposing&ndash;&ndash;well, why shouldn&#8217;t she
take an interest in Pendleton to the extent of
preventing such a finish if she could? There
need be nothing personal in such an interest;
she could work it out as an experiment.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop, now thoroughly warm, began
to prepare her supper. She spread a white cloth
upon her table, which was just large enough to
seat one. She placed upon this one plate, one
cup and saucer, one knife and fork and spoon.
It was a very simple matter to prepare supper
for one. She sliced her small portion of cold
meat and placed this on the table. She removed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
her rolls from a paper bag and placed them beside
the cold meat. By this time the hot water
was ready, and she took a pinch of tea, put it in
her tea-ball, and poured hot water over it in
her cup. Then she took her place in the one
chair.</p>
<p>But, oddly enough, although there was no
place for him, another seemed to be with her in
the room.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Let me have your engagement-book a moment,&#8221;
Frances requested.</p>
<p>Don complied. He had taken his dinner that
night at the dairy lunch, and after returning to
the house to dress had walked to his fianc&eacute;e&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Frances puckered her brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to have a very busy time these next
few weeks,&#8221; she informed him. &#8220;Let me see&ndash;&ndash;to-day
is Wednesday. On Friday we are to go
to the Moores&#8217;. Evelyn&#8217;s d&eacute;butante dance, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrote it in his book.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Saturday we go to the opera. The
Warringtons have asked us to a box party.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrote that.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Next Wednesday comes the Stanley cotillion.
Have you received your invitation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen it,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Stanleys are always unpardonably late,
but I helped Elise make out her list. On the following
Friday we dine at the Westons&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrote that.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the following Saturday I&#8217;m to give a
box party at the opera&ndash;&ndash;the Moores and
Warringtons.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that, and looked over the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose, after going to this trouble,
I&#8217;ll have to remind you all over again on the
day of each event.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me we are getting pretty gay,
aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like an old man!&#8221; she scolded.
&#8220;So far, this has been a very stupid season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, now I&#8217;m in business&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t remind me of that any more
than is necessary,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right; only, I do have to get up in the
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why remind me of that? It&#8217;s disagreeable
enough having to think of it even occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Don. Honestly I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seated herself on the arm of his chair,
with an arm about his neck and her cheek
against his hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think it quite too bad,&#8221; she assured
him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;which is why I don&#8217;t like to talk about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Don, you must practice with me
some of the new steps. You&#8217;ll get very rusty if
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather hear you sing,&#8221; he ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is much more important,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>She placed a Maxixe record on the Victrola
that stood by the piano; then she held out her
arms to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old hard-working Don!&#8221; she laughed
as he rose.</p>
<p>It was true that it was as poor old hard-working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Don he moved toward her. But there
was magic in her lithe young body; there was
magic in her warm hand; there was magic in her
swimming eyes. As he fell into the rhythm of
the music and breathed the incense of her hair,
he was whirled into another world&ndash;&ndash;a world
of laughter and melody and care-free fairies.
But the two most beautiful fairies of all were
her two beautiful eyes, which urged him to
dance faster and faster, and which left him in
the end stooping, with short breaths, above her
upturned lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ROSES</h3>
</div>
<p>When Miss Winthrop changed her mind and
consented not to seek a new luncheon place, she
was taking a chance, and she knew it. If ever
Blake heard of the new arrangement,&ndash;&ndash;and he
was sure to hear of it if any one ever saw her
there with Don,&ndash;&ndash;she was fully aware how he
would interpret it to the whole office.</p>
<p>She was taking a chance, and she knew it&ndash;&ndash;knew
it with a curious sense of elation. She was
taking a chance for him. This hour at noon was
the only opportunity she had of talking to Don.
If she let that pass, then she could do nothing
more for him. She must stand back and watch
him go his own way, as others had gone their
way.</p>
<p>For one thing was certain: she could allow
no further conversations in the office. She had
been forced to stop those, and had warned him
that he must not speak to her again there except
on business, and that he must not sit at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Powers&#8217;s desk and watch her at work. When
he had challenged her for a reason, she had
blushed; then she had replied simply:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t business.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, when on Saturday morning Don came
in heavy-eyed for lack of sleep after the Moore
dance, she merely looked up and nodded
and went on with her work. But she studied
him a dozen times when he did not know she
was studying him, and frowned every time he
suppressed, with difficulty, a yawn. He appeared
tired&ndash;&ndash;dead tired.</p>
<p>For the first time in months she found herself
looking forward to the noon hour. She glanced
at her watch at eleven-thirty, at eleven-forty-five,
and again at five minutes before twelve.</p>
<p>To-day she reserved a seat for him in the
little lunch-room. But at fifteen minutes past
twelve, when Don usually strode in the door,
he had not come. At twenty minutes past he
had not come. If he did not come in another
five minutes she resolved to make no further
effort to keep his place&ndash;&ndash;either to-day or at
any future time. At first she was irritated;
then she was worried. It was possible he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
lunching with Blake. If he began that&ndash;&ndash;well,
she would be freed of all further responsibility,
for one thing. But at this point Don entered.
He made no apologies for having kept her waiting,
but deposited in the empty chair, as he
went off for his sandwich and coffee, a long,
narrow box done up in white paper. She gave
him time to eat a portion of his lunch before she
asked:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out late again last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Went to a dance,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>She was relieved to hear that. It was a better
excuse than some, but still it was not a justifiable
excuse for a man who needed all his
energies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get enough sleep, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; Don admitted cheerfully.
&#8220;In bed at four and up at seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I feel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t keep that up long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunday&#8217;s coming, and I&#8217;m going to sleep
all day,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the use of getting into that
condition?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>He thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t suppose a man can cut off
everything just because he&#8217;s in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of the business&ndash;&ndash;at the beginning,&#8221;
she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;To work all the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To work all the time,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;I wish
I had your chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My chance to work?&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your chance to get ahead,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all so easy&ndash;&ndash;for a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do anything but keep
straight and keep at work. You ought to have
taken those circulars home with you last night
and learned them by heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read &#8217;em. But, hang it all, they don&#8217;t
mean anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then find out what they mean. Keep at it
until you do find out. The firm isn&#8217;t going to
pay you for what you <i>don&#8217;t</i> know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But last night&ndash;&ndash;well, a man has to get
around a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around where?&#8221; she questioned him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among his friends. Doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me you&#8217;ll have to choose between
dances and business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between dances and business. I tell you,
this next six months is going to count a lot
on how you make good with Farnsworth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he isn&#8217;t the only one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the only one in this office&ndash;&ndash;I know
what I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But outside the office&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She put down her fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m mixing up in your
business,&#8221; she declared earnestly. &#8220;Except
that I&#8217;ve been here three years now, and have
seen men come and go. Every time they&#8217;ve
gone it has been clear as daylight why they
went. Farnsworth is square. He hasn&#8217;t much
heart in him, but he&#8217;s square. And he has eyes
in the back of his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her own eyes and looked swiftly
about the room as if she half-expected to discover
him here.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>She did not answer his question, but as she
ran on again she lowered her voice:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been in his office to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave me some more circulars,&#8221; Don
admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better believe he knew you
didn&#8217;t get to bed last night until 4 a.m. And
you&#8217;d better believe he has tucked that away in
his mind somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don appeared worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t say anything. He doesn&#8217;t
say anything until he has a whole collection of
those little things. Even then he doesn&#8217;t say
much; but what he does say&ndash;&ndash;counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s getting ready to fire
me?&#8221; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s always getting ready,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;He&#8217;s always getting ready to fire or advance
you. That&#8217;s the point,&#8221; she went on more
earnestly. &#8220;What I don&#8217;t understand is why
the men who come in here aren&#8217;t getting ready
too. I don&#8217;t see why they don&#8217;t play the game.
I might stay with the firm twenty years and I&#8217;d
still be pounding a typewriter. But you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>She raised her eyes to his. She saw that
Don&#8217;s had grown less dull, and her own warmed
with this initial success.</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to play football, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to know something about
doing things hard; and you ought to know
something about keeping in training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here, it seems to me you take this
mighty seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farnsworth does,&#8221; she corrected. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why he&#8217;s getting ten thousand a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figures recalled a vivid episode.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten thousand a year,&#8221; he repeated after
her. &#8220;Is that what he draws?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they say. Anyway, he&#8217;s
worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think I&ndash;&ndash;I might make a job like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;d try for it if I were in your boots,&#8221;
she answered earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;d land it if you were in my
boots.&#8221; He raised his coffee-cup. &#8220;Here&#8217;s to
the ten thousand a year,&#8221; he drank.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Miss Winthrop rose. She had talked more
than she intended, and was somewhat irritated
at herself. If, for a second, she thought she
had accomplished something, she did not think
so now, as he too rose and smiled at her. He
handed her the pasteboard box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your two dollars is in there,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>She looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I wait five minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, as he thrust the box
into her hands.</p>
<p>That box worried her all the afternoon. Not
having a chance to open it, she hid it beneath
her desk, where it distracted her thoughts until
evening. Of course she could not open it on the
Elevated, so it lay in her lap, still further to
distract her thoughts on the way home. It
seemed certain that a two-dollar bill could not
occupy all that space.</p>
<p>She did not wait even to remove her hat before
opening it in her room. She found a little
envelope containing her two-dollar bill nestling
in five dollars&#8217; worth of roses.</p>
<p>It was about as foolish a thing as she had
ever known a man to do.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>She placed the flowers on the table when she
had her supper. All night long they filled the
room with their fragrance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A MAN OF AFFAIRS</h3>
</div>
<p>When, with some eighteen dollars in his
pocket, Don on Sunday ordered Nora to prepare
for him on that day and during the following
week a breakfast of toast, eggs, and coffee, he
felt very much a man of affairs. He was paying
for his own sustenance, and with the first money
he had ever earned. He drew from his pocket
a ten-dollar bill, a five-dollar bill, a two-dollar
bill, and some loose change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick out what you need,&#8221; he ordered, as he
held the money toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much it will be, sir. I&#8217;ll
ask the cook, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; ask the cook. About dinners&ndash;&ndash;I
think I&#8217;d better wait until I see how I&#8217;m
coming out. Dinners don&#8217;t matter so much,
any way, because they come after I&#8217;m through
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don ate his breakfast in the dining-room
before the open fire, as his father used to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
In smoking-jacket and slippered feet, he enjoyed
this as a rare luxury&ndash;&ndash;even this matter
of breakfasting at home, which until now had
been merely a negative detail of routine.</p>
<p>When he had finished he drew his chair closer
to the flames and lighted a cigarette. He had
been cutting down on cigarettes. He had always
bought them by the hundred; he was now
buying them by the box. Until this week he
never realized that they represented money.
He was paying now twenty-five cents for a box
of ten; and twenty-five cents, as he had learned
in the restaurant in the alley, was a sum of
money with tremendous possibilities. It would
buy, for one thing, five egg sandwiches; and five
egg sandwiches would keep a man from being
uncomfortably hungry a good many hours.</p>
<p>Thus a quarter, from being merely an odd
piece of loose change, took on a vital, tangible
character of its own. Translated into smokes,
it gave a smoke a new value. He had started in
to make a box of cigarettes last a day; but he
was now resolved to make them last two days.
This allowed him one after each meal and two
in the evening.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>If at first he had considered this a hardship,
he was beginning to appreciate the fact that it
had its compensating advantages. This morning,
for instance, he felt that he had never
tasted such good tobacco in his life. Like his
breakfast, it was a pleasure to be prolonged&ndash;&ndash;to
give his thought to. He smoked slowly and
carefully and keenly. With his head against the
back of his chair, he watched the white cloudlets
curl upward after he had inhaled their
fragrance. This was no dull habit indulged in
automatically.</p>
<p>In this moment of indulgence his thoughts
turned to Miss Winthrop. It was nearing
twelve, and perhaps this had something to do
with it. He was going to miss that luncheon
hour. He had come to look forward to it as
quite the most interesting event of the day.
From his comfortable position before the fire,
he wondered why.</p>
<p>It was impossible to say she had any definite
physical attractions, although her eyes were not
bad. They piqued a man&#8217;s curiosity, those eyes.
One remembered them. That was true also of
her mouth. Don had no very definite notion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
its exact shape, but he remembered how it surprised
one by changing from the tenderness of a
young girl&#8217;s mouth to the firmness of a man&#8217;s a
dozen times in the course of a few minutes&#8217;
conversation.</p>
<p>It was quarter-past twelve. If he had known
her telephone number he would have called her
up now, just to say &#8220;Hello.&#8221; He would be taking
a chance, however; for, as likely as not, she
would inquire what he was doing, and would, he
felt sure, scold him for having so late a breakfast.</p>
<p>Odd, that a woman should be so energetic!
He had always thought of them as quite the
opposite. Leisureliness was a prerogative of the
sex. He had always understood that it was a
woman&#8217;s right to pamper herself.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly she would object to his sitting
on here before the open fire. Farnsworth would
not waste a morning like this&ndash;&ndash;he seemed to
hear her telling him so. If he wanted that ten
thousand a year, he ought to be working on
those circulars. A man was not paid for what he
didn&#8217;t know. Here, with nothing else to do,
was a good time to get after them. Well, he had
gone so far as to bring them home with him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>He rose reluctantly, went upstairs to his
room, and brought them down. He began on
the electric company which was offering gold
bonds at a price to net four and a half per
cent. Then Nora came in to call him to the
telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Nora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stuyvesant, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried to the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad and Mother have gone to church and
it&#8217;s very stupid here,&#8221; she complained. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you come over?&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated the fraction of a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&ndash;&ndash;if you don&#8217;t want to,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
she began quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, Frances. Of course I want to
come; only, there were some papers I brought
home from the office&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can go over them some other time. I&#8217;ll be
right up.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A discovery that encouraged Don the following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
week was that by some unconscious power
of absorption he grew sufficiently familiar with
the financial jargon of the office to feel that it
really was within the possibilities that some day
he might understand it fully. He found several
opportunities to talk with Powers, and the
latter, after recovering from his surprise at the
primitive nature of some of Don&#8217;s questions
about notes and bonds, went to some trouble
to answer them. Not only that, but he mentioned
certain books that might supply fuller
and more fundamental information.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know these sound like fool questions,&#8221;
Don apologized, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve never been down in
this end of the town much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied Powers. &#8220;Come
to me any time you&#8217;re stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Powers went out, Don sat down and
tried to recall some of the things he had been
told. He remembered some of them and some
of them he didn&#8217;t. But that day at lunch
Miss Winthrop handed him a stenographic report
of the entire conversation. Don looked
over it in amazement. It was in the form of
question and answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p><i>Mr. Pendleton:</i> Say, old man, what is a gold
bond, anyway?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Powers:</i> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>And so on down to Don&#8217;s final apology.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Pendleton:</i> I know these sound like fool
questions&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Powers:</i> That&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it over in your spare time,&#8221; advised
Miss Winthrop; &#8220;then you won&#8217;t ask him the
same questions twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how in thunder did you get this?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t busy just then, and took it down.
I knew you&#8217;d forget half he told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mighty good of you,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;But I wish you had left out my talk. Now
that I see it in type, it sounds even more foolish
than I thought it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot of things that didn&#8217;t turn
out well in type,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;But you needn&#8217;t
read that part of it. What Powers said
was worth while. He knows what he&#8217;s talking
about, and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s the best bond salesman
in the house.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a salary does <i>he</i> draw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And if I
were you I&#8217;d forget the salary end of my job
for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty important end,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; she returned frankly. &#8220;I
suppose you&#8217;re starting on twenty-five?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all you&#8217;re worth. Any one to support
besides yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what you worrying about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, good Heavens, a man can&#8217;t live on
that&ndash;&ndash;any length of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t? I know men who support a wife
and children on less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do it decently,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;I live
on half of that myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Did you think I drew a salary
like Farnsworth?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed at his open astonishment. It
appeared genuine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You live on half of twenty-five dollars a
week?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>She did not care to pursue the subject. It
was a bit too personal.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do hundreds of thousands of others,&#8221;
she informed him. &#8220;On that and less than that.
Now, you put that paper away in your pocket,
and don&#8217;t ask Powers another question until
you know it by heart. Then get after him again.
When you run across something you don&#8217;t
know, why don&#8217;t you write it down?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took out his engagement-book on the
spot and made an entry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve written down that you say it&#8217;s possible
to live on twenty-five dollars a week,&#8221; he
informed her, as he replaced the book in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;You&#8217;d better
write down something about not worrying
about your salary at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>He took out his engagement-book again
and scribbled a line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Winthrop says not to worry about
my salary.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s your very words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she grew really confused. &#8220;I
mean&ndash;&ndash;you needn&#8217;t put it down that I said
it. You ought to say it to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s too deep for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s drop the subject,&#8221; she answered
curtly. &#8220;Only don&#8217;t get the idea that it&#8217;s I
who am worrying about your salary, one way
or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need of getting peeved about it,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the slightest,&#8221; she agreed.</p>
<p>But she did not wait for her &eacute;clair, and went
back to the office in anything but a good humor.</p>
<p>On the whole, Miss Winthrop was rather
disappointed in him as a result of this last interview&ndash;&ndash;the
more so because he had begun the
day so well. Her hopes had risen high at the
way he approached Powers, and at the seriousness
with which he had listened to what Powers
had to say. He had acted like a man eager
to learn. Then he had spoiled it all by placing
undue emphasis on the salary end.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>This new development in Pendleton came
as a surprise. It did not seem consistent with
his nature as she read it in his eyes. It was not
in character. It left her doubting her judgment
about him along other lines. She did not object
to his ambition. That was essential. He ought
to work for Farnsworth&#8217;s position&ndash;&ndash;but for the
position, not the salary. The position stood
for power based upon ability. That was the
sort of success she would be keen about if she
were a man.</p>
<p>Curious, too, that Mr. Pendleton should be
so keen about money in this one direction. She
had thought his tendency all the other way,
and had made a mental note that sometime
she must drive home to him a few facts about
having a decent respect for money. A man who
would return the loan of a two-dollar bill in
five dollars&#8217; worth of roses was not the sort of
man one expected to have a vaulting ambition
for thousands for their own sake. One thing
was sure&ndash;&ndash;he was not the type of man who
ought to occupy so much of her attention on a
busy afternoon.</p>
<p>At a few minutes before five, just as Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Winthrop was jabbing the last pin into her hat,
a messenger boy hurried into the office with a
parcel bearing a noticeable resemblance to a
one-pound candy box. He inquired of Eddie
for Miss Winthrop, and Eddie, with considerable
ceremony, escorted the boy to the desk of
that astonished young woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sign here,&#8221; the boy ordered.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop gave a swift glance around
the office. Mr. Pendleton was at work at Powers&#8217;s
desk and didn&#8217;t even look up. It was a
remarkable exhibition of concentration on his
part. Blake, however, swung around in his
chair and raised his brows.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop seized the pencil and wrote
her name, dotting the &#8220;i&#8221; and crossing the &#8220;t&#8221;
with vicious jabs. Then she picked up the box
and hurried toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a devoted admirer?&#8221; inquired Blake,
as she passed him.</p>
<p>Don saw the color spring to Miss Winthrop&#8217;s
cheeks, but she hurried on without a word in
reply. He understood now what it was she did
not like about Blake. Don was not at all of an
aggressive nature, but at that moment he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
have struck the man with the greatest satisfaction.
It seemed the only adequate way of expressing
himself. Blake was still smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort of caught her with the goods that
time, eh?&#8221; observed Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you,&#8221; answered Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Candy by messenger? Well, I&#8217;ve been looking
for it. And when those haughty ones do
fall, believe me, they fall hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; answered Don. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll bet you
five dollars to a quarter you&#8217;re wrong about
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s eyes narrowed a trifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;What&#8217;s your
proof?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent her that stuff myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You? Holy smoke, that&#8217;s going some!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent her that to pay for some typewriting
she did for me and because I knew she wouldn&#8217;t
take any money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lose. Come out and have a drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; answered Don. &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way
uptown. Give that quarter to Eddie.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>IT WILL NEVER DO</h3>
</div>
<p>If Miss Winthrop ever had more than a nodding
acquaintance with Mr. Pendleton, she
gave no indication of that fact when she came
in the next morning. With a face as blank as a
house closed for the season, she clicked away
at her typewriter until noon, and then hurried
out to lunch as if that were a purely business
transaction also. Don followed a little sooner
than usual. The little restaurant was not at all
crowded to-day, but she was not there. He
waited ten minutes, and as he waited the conviction
grew that she did not intend to come.</p>
<p>Don went out and began an investigation.
He visited five similar places in the course of
the next fifteen minutes, and in the last one
he found her. She was seated in a far corner,
and she was huddled up as if trying to make
herself as inconspicuous as possible. As he
strode to her side with uplifted hat, she shrank
away like a hunted thing finding itself trapped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What did you run away for?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you hunt me up for?&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I wanted to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I came here because I did <i>not</i> want to
see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should think you&#8217;d go along and leave
me alone,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did that, then I&#8217;d never know what the
trouble is all about,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an empty chair next to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t prevent you, but I&#8217;ve told you I
want to be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look that way, you&#8217;re just as
much alone as if I weren&#8217;t here,&#8221; he returned,
as he took the chair. &#8220;And every one knows
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a swift glance about the room, as if
expecting to find half the crowd looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they are too polite to let on,&#8221; he
continued; &#8220;but I know just what they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
saying to themselves. They are saying, &#8216;She
certainly hasn&#8217;t much use for him. You&#8217;d
think he&#8217;d take the tip and get out.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to care much, then, about
what they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a hang,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>She pushed her plate away as if ready to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
seem like you to go off and leave a man in the
dark. How in thunder am I going to know any
better next time if you don&#8217;t tell me where I
made the break?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;d know if I did tell
you,&#8221; she answered more gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The least you can do is to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not want to tell him. If he was sincere&ndash;&ndash;and
the longer she talked with him, the
more convinced she was that this was the case&ndash;&ndash;then
she did not wish to disillusionize him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The least you can do is to give me a
chance,&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mistake came in the beginning, Mr.
Pendleton,&#8221; she said, with an effort. &#8220;And it
was all my fault. You&ndash;&ndash;you seemed so different
from a lot of men who come into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
office that I&ndash;&ndash;well, I wanted to see you get
started straight. In the three years I&#8217;ve been
there I&#8217;ve picked up a lot of facts that aren&#8217;t
much use to me because&ndash;&ndash;because I&#8217;m just
Miss Winthrop. So I thought I could pass
them on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was mighty white of you,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>The color flashed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I could do that much without
interfering in any other way with either of
our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two or three things I didn&#8217;t
reckon with,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were they?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blake is one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blake?&#8221; His face brightened with sudden
understanding. &#8220;Then the trouble is all about
that box of candy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have sent it. You should
have known better than to send it. You&ndash;&ndash;had
no right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that was nothing. You were so darned
good to me about the typewriting and it was
all I could think of.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So, you see,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;it won&#8217;t do.
It won&#8217;t do at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s because you didn&#8217;t see the way
Blake looked at me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I could have
hit him for it. But I fixed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;fixed that?&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did. I told him I sent the box,
and told him why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Then they&#8217;ll all
know, and&ndash;&ndash;what am I going to do? Oh, what
am I going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a pitiful cry. He did not understand
why it was so intense, because he did not see
what she saw&ndash;&ndash;the gossip increasing in maliciousness;
the constant watching and nods and
winks, until in the end it became intolerable
either to her or to Farnsworth. Nor was that
the possible end. To leave an office under these
conditions was a serious matter&ndash;&ndash;a matter so
serious as to affect her whole future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take
it so hard. You&#8217;re making too much of it. Blake
isn&#8217;t going to talk any more. If he does&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>She raised her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does, there isn&#8217;t anything you can do
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet there is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;<i>no</i>. There isn&#8217;t. I know! But
you mustn&#8217;t come here any more. And you
mustn&#8217;t talk to me any more. Then perhaps
they&#8217;ll forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grew serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems too bad if it&#8217;s got to be that
way,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have known,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I ought to have known, too. I was a
fool to send that box into the office, but I
wanted you to get it before you went home.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to his a moment. Then
a queer, tender expression softened her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the end of it,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And
now I&#8217;m glad you did not know any better.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose to go, and then she noticed that
he had not lunched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait here until you come back with
your sandwich,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a sandwich,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please hurry.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>So she waited there until he came back with
his lunch, and then she held out her hand to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow you go to the old place,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll come here.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>DICTATION</h3>
</div>
<p>As far as Don was concerned, Miss Winthrop,
instead of merely changing her lunch-place,
might just as well have taken a steamer and
sailed for Europe. He saw her at her desk
every morning when he came in, and she always
looked up and nodded&ndash;&ndash;as she did, for
that matter, to every one, including Blake.
Then she turned to her work, and that was
the end of her until the next morning. As far
as he was able to judge, Miss Winthrop had
completely and utterly forgotten the preceding
weeks and even the incident that led to this
disastrous climax.</p>
<p>But the situation that left her so unaffected
got on Don&#8217;s nerves. He was by nature too
much of a social being to endure being left to
himself very long. This lunching alone day
after day was a dreary affair. The egg sandwiches
began to pall upon his taste, and he felt
that he could not have eaten an &eacute;clair had he
been starving.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>Sometimes he had only a cup of coffee, and
then hurried out and wandered about the
streets for the remainder of his hour. It was a
long hour&ndash;&ndash;a tedious hour. Most of the time
he spent in the hope that, by some lucky
chance, he might meet her. He did not hunt
for her. He avoided her usual course. If he
met her, it must be honestly by chance. But
he never met her. He passed thousands of
other young women, but he never met her. He
used to return to the office sometimes doubting
that she existed. But at one o&#8217;clock she
was always there back of her machine.</p>
<p>He spent a good deal of time that week with
Powers; and seemed to make some progress.
He had now a definite knowledge of bonds and
notes, and had even mastered, in a general
way, the important details of some of the issues
the house was handling. Twice he had taken
home his papers and actually spent several
hours upon them. Some of them he knew almost
by heart. It was encouraging, but it
would have been much more encouraging if he
had been able to tell Miss Winthrop about it.</p>
<p>Somehow, he did not feel that he really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
knew those things until he had told her he
knew them. This was a curious frame of mind
to be in, but it was a fact.</p>
<p>As far as he was concerned, he would have
broken through this embargo long ago. But
she had made him see, and see clearly, that he
was <i>not</i> alone concerned. That was the whole
trouble. If Blake talked only about him, and
let it go at that, no harm would be done.</p>
<p>One Friday morning, toward eleven o&#8217;clock,
Blake was out of the office, and Don had just
finished a long talk with Powers, when he
noticed that Miss Winthrop was not for the
moment busy.</p>
<p>Don had an inspiration. He caught Powers
just as he was about to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, old man,&#8221; he said in an undertone.
&#8220;Is there any objection to my dictating
a letter to Miss Winthrop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; answered Powers. &#8220;She&#8217;s there
for the use of the staff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d like to have her take down
some of the things we&#8217;ve been talking about,&#8221;
he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; nodded Powers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>A minute later Miss Winthrop caught her
breath as Don calmly walked to her desk, seated
himself in a chair near her, and, producing
a circular from his pocket, followed Blake&#8217;s
formula in asking:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you take a letter for me, Miss Winthrop?&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost as automatically as she answered
Blake, she replied:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached for her notebook and pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>My dear Madame</i>,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any address, Mr. Pendleton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the exact address,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Just address it to the little restaurant
in the alley.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Pendleton!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the little restaurant in the alley,&#8221; he
continued calmly. &#8220;Do you use Madame or
Mademoiselle to an unmarried lady?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this is a strictly business letter,
or you would not be dictating it in office hours,&#8221;
she returned.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it partly business,&#8221; he nodded.
&#8220;Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Pendleton; but I don&#8217;t think&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is introducing the personal element
now?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready, Mr. Pendleton.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>My dear Madame</i>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>In reply to your advice that I acquire certain
information relative to the securities which our
firm is offering for sale, I beg to report that, after
several talks with our Mr. Powers, I am prepared
to give you any information you may desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Try me on one of them?&#8221; he suggested, interrupting
himself.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes and glanced anxiously
around the office. Then she replied, as if reading
from her notebook:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget, Mr. Pendleton, that I am taking
a letter from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me on one of the bonds,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t act like this. Really, you
mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll dictate some more. Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Pendleton.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>Our Miss Winthrop has just informed me that
you have lost your interest in the whole matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that, Mr. Pendleton,&#8221; she
interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said that here in the office&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. Then scratch that sentence out.&#8221;</p>
<p>She scratched it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have it read this way&#8221;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Our Miss Winthrop informs me&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why need you bring me in at all?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t interrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;informs me that, owing to the lack of privacy
in the office, you cannot discuss these matters
here with me. Therefore I suggest that, as long as
the luncheon hour is no longer convenient (for the
same reasons), an arrangement be made whereby
I may have the pleasure of dining with you some
evening.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop&#8217;s brows came together.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is absolutely impossible!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>If the idea does not appeal to you as a pleasure,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>he went on in the most impersonal of tones,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>perhaps you would be willing to consider it as a
favor. Our Miss Winthrop informs me that the
suggestion is impossible, but personally I don&#8217;t
see how anything could be more easily arranged.
I would prefer Saturday evening, as on that date
I am quite sure of being sufficiently well provided
with ducats&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better save them,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;to insure a proper settlement with the
waiter,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>he concluded his sentence.</p>
<p>Please let me know, then, where I may meet
you on Saturday evening next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that was quite impossible, Mr.
Pendleton,&#8221; she reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a hundred reasons, and they
can&#8217;t be discussed here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; he exclaimed triumphantly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the whole trouble! We can&#8217;t discuss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
things here; so let&#8217;s have our little dinner, and
then there&#8217;ll be all the chance in the world for
you to tell me why you shouldn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re absurd,&#8221; she declared, with an involuntary
smile.</p>
<p>Hoping for the favor of an early reply,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>he concluded,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I beg to remain, Madame, most sincerely yours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might add this postscript&#8221;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I shall be at the Harvard Club at seven to-night,
and a &#8217;phone message there might be the
most convenient way of replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really wish this typed, Mr. Pendleton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it best,&#8221; he replied as he rose,
&#8220;unless you&#8217;re too tired?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never tired in business hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>He returned to his desk; in a few seconds he
heard the click of her machine.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop did not stop at the delicatessen
store that night, but went direct to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
room. She removed her hat and coat, and
then sat down, chin in hands, to think this
problem out.</p>
<p>She had missed Pendleton at the luncheon
hour to a distinctly discomfiting degree. Naturally
enough, she held him wholly responsible
for that state of mind. Her life had been going
along smoothly until he took it upon himself
to come into the office. There had been no
complications&ndash;&ndash;no worries. She was earning
enough to provide her with a safe retreat at
night, and to clothe and feed her body; and
this left her free, within certain accepted
limits, to do as she pleased. This was her enviable
condition when Mr. Pendleton came
along&ndash;&ndash;came from Heaven knew where, and
took up his position near her desk. Then he
had happened upon her at the little restaurant.
And he was hungry and had only thirteen
cents.</p>
<p>Perhaps right there was where she had made
her mistake. It appeared that a woman could
not be impersonally decent to a man without
being held personally responsible. If she did
not telephone him to-night, Pendleton would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
be disappointed, and, being disappointed,
Heaven only knew what he would do.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, perhaps the wisest
thing she could do was to meet him this once
and make him clearly understand that she was
never to meet him again. Pendleton was young,
and he had not been long enough in the office
to learn the downtown conventions. It was
her fault that she had interested herself in him
in the first place. It was her fault that she
had allowed him to lunch with her. It was her
fault that she had not been strictly businesslike
with him in the office. So she would have dinner
with him, and that would end it.</p>
<p>She had some tea and crackers, and at half-past
six put on her things and took a short
walk. At seven she went into a public pay
station, rang up the Harvard Club, and called
for Mr. Pendleton. When she heard his voice
her cheeks turned scarlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist I&#8217;ll come to-morrow night,&#8221;
she informed him. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want you to understand that I don&#8217;t
approve of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;Where may I call for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave her address.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll call there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I call that mighty good of you,&#8221; he
ran on. &#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she concluded sharply.</p>
<p>She hung up the receiver and went back to
her room in anything but a comfortable frame
of mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>STEAK, WITH MUSHROOMS AND ADVICE</h3>
</div>
<p>All of Miss Winthrop that occupied a desk
in the office of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves on
the next day was that for which Farnsworth
was paying a weekly wage of twelve dollars.
From the moment she entered that morning
until she left that afternoon she made this perfectly
clear to every one, including Don. But
he also was busy. He had determined to make
himself letter perfect on several bond issues.
To this end he worked as hard as ever he had
the day before a final examination. Besides
this, Farnsworth found three or four errands
for him to do, which he accomplished with dispatch.
All that week Farnsworth had used
him more and more&ndash;&ndash;a distinctly encouraging
sign. Don knew offhand now the location
of some ten or fifteen offices, and was received
in them as the recognized representative of
Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves. In some places he
was even known by name and addressed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Mr. Pendleton&ndash;&ndash;which filled him with considerable
pride.</p>
<p>Don went direct to his house from the office,
dressed, and went to the club.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one rings me up, get the name,&#8221;
he ordered the doorman.</p>
<p>He avoided the crowd before the bar, and
went upstairs to the library. He had brought
his circulars with him, and now went over
them once again in order to refresh his memory
on some of the details. He was as anxious
about getting this right as if Miss Winthrop
were a prospective customer. Perhaps
she might be. Women invested money, and if
he was persuasive enough he might sell her a
thousand-dollar bond. If he did not sell one
to her, he might sell a few to Barton. Barton
was always investing money&ndash;&ndash;investing the
Pendleton money, in fact. He might suggest
Barton to Farnsworth, and drop around and
see him to-morrow. Then Barton might suggest
some one else. Before night he might in
this way sell a couple of dozen of these bonds.
He grew excited at the idea. He felt a new instinct
stirring within him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>Don had never sold anything in his life except
a few old clothes to second-hand clothes
men in Cambridge. Strictly speaking, that
was more in the nature of a gift than a sale:
for a hundred dollars&#8217; worth of clothes, he received
perhaps ten dollars, which he felt
obliged to spend on his friends at the first
opportunity.</p>
<p>Don had always been a buyer&ndash;&ndash;a talent
that required neither preparation nor development.
Money had always passed from him
to some one else. This was pleasant enough,
but undramatic. There was no clash; it called
for no effort on his part. To reverse all this
and watch the money pass in the other direction&ndash;&ndash;from
some one else to him&ndash;&ndash;impressed
him as a pleasant variation.</p>
<p>At seven o&#8217;clock Don replaced his circulars
in his pocket and went downstairs. Wadsworth
passed him, and for a moment Don was
tempted to stop him and try out his knowledge
of bonds on him. The club, however, was
hardly the place for that. But if ever he met
Wadsworth on the street he would see what
he could do. Wadsworth had never been more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
than an acquaintance of his, but now he saw
in him a prospective customer.</p>
<p>Don stepped into a taxi at the door and gave
the driver the address supplied by Miss Winthrop.
The cab after a little came to a stop
before one of several entrances in a long brick
block. Before Don had time to reach the door
Miss Winthrop stepped out. He had rather
hoped for an opportunity to meet some of her
family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I late?&#8221; he inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>He could not account in any other way for
the fact that she had hurried out before he had
a chance to send in his card.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Did you come in
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was looking at the taxi.</p>
<p>He nodded, and stood at the door, ready to
assist her in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you may send it away now,&#8221; she informed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go in it,&#8221; she insisted firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid it will break down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to send it away?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>Without further argument he paid the driver
and sent him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t right to waste money like that,&#8221;
she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was the trouble? But it wouldn&#8217;t
have cost more than a couple of dollars to have
gone back with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two dollars! That&#8217;s carfare for three
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if you look at it that way. But
here we are away uptown, and&ndash;&ndash;hanged if I
know how to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around, as bewildered as a lost
child. She could not help laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re as helpless as that I don&#8217;t see how
you ever get home at night,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He looked in every direction, but he did not
see a car line. He turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t help you,&#8221; she said, shaking her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to walk until we come to
the Elevated,&#8221; he determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;Only, if you don&#8217;t
go in the right direction you will walk all night
before you come to the Elevated.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I can ask some one, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly would before I walked very far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, madame, but would you be
so good&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, turn to the right,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;And
do put on your hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a quiet little French restaurant of
the better kind to which he took her&ndash;&ndash;a place
he had stumbled on one evening, and to which
he occasionally went when the club menu did
not appeal to him. Jacques had reserved a
table in a corner, and had arranged there the
violets that Monsieur Pendleton had sent for
this purpose. On the whole, it was just as well
Miss Winthrop did not know this, or of the tip
that was to lead to a certain kind of salad and
to an extravagant dish with mushrooms to
come later. It is certain that Monsieur Pendleton
knew how to arrange a dinner from every
other but the economical end.</p>
<p>Don was very much himself to-night, and in
an exceedingly good humor. In no time he
made her also feel very much herself and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
her into an equally good humor. Her cares, her
responsibilities, her fears, vanished as quickly
as if the last three or four years had taught her
nothing. She had started with set lips, and
here she was with smiling ones. In the half-hour
that she waited in her room for him, she
had rehearsed a half-dozen set speeches; now
she did not recall one of them.</p>
<p>Don suggested wine, but she shook her head.
She had no need of wine. It was wine enough
just to be out of her room at night; wine enough
just to get away from the routine of her own
meals; wine enough just not to be alone; wine
enough just to get away from her own sex for
a little.</p>
<p>Don chatted on aimlessly through the anchovies,
the soup, and fish, and she enjoyed
listening to him. He was the embodiment of
youth, and he made even her feel like a care-free
girl of sixteen again. This showed in her
face, in the relaxed muscles about her mouth,
and in her brightened eyes.</p>
<p>Then, during the long wait for the steak and
mushrooms, his face became serious, and he
leaned across the table.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he began, &#8220;the house has received
a new allotment of bonds; I want to tell
you about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had his facts well in hand, and he spoke
with conviction and an unconventionality of
expression that made her listen. She knew a
good salesman when she heard one, whether
she was familiar with the particular subject-matter
or not. The quality of salesmanship
really had nothing to do with the subject-matter.
A good salesman can sell anything.
It has rather to do with that unknown gift
which distinguishes an actor able to pack a
house from an actor with every other quality
able only to half fill a house. It has nothing to
do with general intelligence; it has nothing to
do with conscientious preparation; it has nothing
to do with anything but itself. It corresponds
to what in a woman is called charm, and
which may go with a pug nose or freckles or a
large mouth. But it cannot be cultivated. It
either is or is not.</p>
<p>It was the mushrooms and steak that interrupted
him. Jacques was trying to draw his
attention to the sizzling hot platter which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
was holding for his inspection&ndash;&ndash;a work of art
in brown and green. Ordinarily Monsieur
Pendleton took some time to appreciate his
efforts. Now he merely nodded:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame sees it?&#8221; he ventured.</p>
<p>Madame, who was sitting with her chin
in her hands, staring across the table at Monsieur,
started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;It is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, when Jacques turned away to carve,
she continued to stare again at Mr. Pendleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in you,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, what a
chance you have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;ll do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that in two years you&#8217;ll be outselling
any one in the office,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>His face flushed at the praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;And within
another year Farnsworth will pay you anything
you demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten thousand?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A gift like yours is worth that to the house&ndash;&ndash;if
you don&#8217;t spoil it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean you must keep it fresh and
clean and free, and not mix it up with money,&#8221;
she ran on eagerly. &#8220;You must keep right on
selling for the fun of the game and not for the
gain. The gain will come fast enough. Don&#8217;t
worry about that. But if you make it the end, it
may make an end of your gift. And you mustn&#8217;t
get foolish with success. And you mustn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;oh,
there are a hundred ways of spoiling it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was her apparent sure knowledge of these
things that constantly surprised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve seen and heard. All I can do
is to stop, look, and listen, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And warn the speeders?&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could do that much it would be something,&#8221;
she answered wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you warn me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She met his eyes with a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot of men start right, but they
don&#8217;t stay right. Why don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But a lot of them do,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they are the kind that just stay. I
hate that kind. I hate people who just stay.
That&#8217;s why I hate myself sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up at her quickly. It was the first
indication he had that she was not continually
in an unbroken state of calm content. He
caught her brown eyes grown suddenly full,
as if they themselves had been startled by the
unexpected exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you said?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>She tried to laugh, but she was still too
disconcerted to make it a successful effort.
She was not often goaded into as intimate a
confession as this.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth repeating,&#8221; she answered
uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you hated yourself sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The steak is very, very good,&#8221; she answered,
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you aren&#8217;t hating yourself now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she replied quickly. &#8220;It&#8217;s only
when I get serious and&ndash;&ndash;please don&#8217;t let&#8217;s be
serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the dinner was very satisfactory,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
for he left her nothing to do but sit back and
enjoy herself. And he made her laugh, sharing
with him his laughter. It was half-past ten
when they arose and went out upon the street.
There she kept right on forgetting. It was
not until she stood in her room, half-undressed,
that she remembered she had not told Pendleton
that to-night was positively to bring
to an end this impossible friendship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A SOCIAL WIDOW</h3>
</div>
<p>With the approach of the holiday season,
when pretty nearly every one comes back to
town, Frances found her engagements multiplying
so rapidly that it required a good deal
of tact and not a little arithmetic to keep them
from conflicting. In this emergency, when she
really needed Don, not only was he of no practical
help, but he further embarrassed her by
announcing a blanket refusal of all afternoon
engagements. This placed her in the embarrassing
position of being obliged to go alone
and then apologize for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Don is in business now,&#8221; was her stock
explanation.</p>
<p>She was irritated with Don for having placed
her in this position. In return for having surrendered
to him certain privileges, she had
expected him to fulfill certain obligations. If
she had promised to allow him to serve exclusively
as her social partner, then he should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
have been at all times available. He had no
right to leave her a social widow&ndash;&ndash;even when
he could not help it. As far as the afternoons
were concerned, the poor boy could not help
it&ndash;&ndash;she knew that; but, even so, why should
her winter be broken up by what some one
else could not help?</p>
<p>She had given her consent to Don, not to
a business man. As Don he had been delightful.
No girl could ask to have a more attentive
and thoughtful fianc&eacute; than he had been.
He allowed her to make all his engagements for
him, and he never failed her. He was the only
man she knew who could sit through a tea
without appearing either silly or bored. And he
was nice&ndash;&ndash;but not too nice&ndash;&ndash;to all her girl
friends, so that most of them were jealous of her.
Decidedly, she had had nothing to complain of.</p>
<p>And she had not complained, even when he
announced that he was penniless. This did
not affect her feeling toward Don himself. It
was something of a nuisance, but, after all,
a matter of no great consequence. She had
no doubt he could make all the money he
wanted, just as her father had done.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>But of late it had been increasingly difficult
to persuade him, on account of business, to
fulfill even his evening engagements. He was
constantly reminding her of bonds and things
that he must study. Well, if it was necessary
for him to study bonds and things, he should
find some way of doing it that would not interfere
with her plans.</p>
<p>The climax came when he asked to be excused
from the Moore cotillion because he had
three other dances for that week.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;Farnsworth is
going to let me go out and sell as soon as I&#8217;m
fit, and so I&#8217;m putting in a lot of extra time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Farnsworth?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s the general manager. I&#8217;ve told
you about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember now. But, Don dear, you
aren&#8217;t going to <i>sell</i> things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I am,&#8221; he answered enthusiastically.
&#8220;All I&#8217;m waiting for is a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you sell?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investment securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed rather pleased that she was showing
so much interest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You see, the house buys a batch of securities
wholesale and then sells them at retail&ndash;&ndash;just
as a grocer does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should call it anything but an attractive
occupation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t understand.
You see, here&#8217;s a man with some extra money
to invest. Now, when you go to him, maybe
he has something else in mind to do with that
money. What you have to do&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t go into details, Don,&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;You know I wouldn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d just let me explain once,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would only irritate me,&#8221; she warned.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would only furnish you with another
reason why you shouldn&#8217;t go about as
much as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I want
to make it clear. Don&#8217;t you see that if I keep
at this for a few years&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Years?&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, until I get my ten thousand.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But I thought you were planning to have
that by next fall at the latest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to try hard. But, somehow, it doesn&#8217;t look
as easy as it did before I started. I didn&#8217;t understand
what a man has to know before he&#8217;s
worth all that money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t find ten thousand to be
very much,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t much to spend,&#8221; he admitted,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s a whole lot to earn. I know
a bunch of men who don&#8217;t earn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they must be very stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but somehow dollars look bigger downtown
than they do uptown. Why, I know a
little restaurant down there where a dollar
looks as big as ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, dear, you&#8217;re living too much downtown,&#8221;
she exclaimed somewhat petulantly.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize it, but you are. It&#8217;s making
you different&ndash;&ndash;and I don&#8217;t want you
different. I want you just as you used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fell back upon a straight appeal&ndash;&ndash;an
appeal of eyes and arms and lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I miss you awfully in the afternoons,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
went on, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll admit that can&#8217;t be helped.
I&#8217;ll give up that much of you. But after dinner
I claim you. You&#8217;re mine after dinner, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very tender and beautiful in this
mood. When he saw her like this, nothing else
seemed to matter. There was no downtown or
uptown; there was only she. There was nothing
to do but stoop and kiss her eager lips.
Which is exactly what he did.</p>
<p>For a moment she allowed it, and then with
an excited laugh freed herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please to give me one of your cards, Don,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>He handed her a card, and she wrote upon
it this:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>December sixteenth, Moore cotillion</i>.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII_DEAR_SIR' id='CHAPTER_XIII_DEAR_SIR'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>DEAR SIR&ndash;&ndash;</h3>
</div>
<p>Don never had an opportunity to test his
knowledge of the bonds about which he had
laboriously acquired so much information, because
within the next week all these offerings
had been sold and their places taken by new
securities. These contained an entirely different
set of figures. It seemed to him that all his
previous work was wasted. He must begin
over again; and, as far as he could see, he must
keep on beginning over again indefinitely. He
felt that Farnsworth had deprived him of an
opportunity, and this had the effect of considerably
dampening his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Then, too, during December and most of
January Frances kept him very busy. He had
never seen her so gay or so beautiful. She
was like a fairy sprite ever dancing to dizzy
music. He followed her in a sort of daze from
dinner to dance, until the strains of music
whirled through his head all day long.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>The more he saw of her, the more he desired
of her. In Christmas week, when every
evening was filled and he was with her from
eight in the evening until two and three and
four the next morning, he would glance at his
watch every ten minutes during the following
day. The hours from nine to five were interminable.
He wandered restlessly about the
office, picking up paper and circular, only to
drop them after an uneasy minute or two. The
entire office staff faded into the background.
Even Miss Winthrop receded until she became
scarcely more than a figure behind a typewriter.
When he was sent out by Farnsworth,
he made as long an errand of it as he could.
He was gone an hour, or an hour and a half, on
commissions that should not have taken half
the time.</p>
<p>It was the week of the Moore cotillion that
Miss Winthrop observed the change in him.
She took it to be a natural enough reaction
and had half-expected it. There were very few
men, her observation had told her, who could
sustain themselves at their best for any length
of time. This was an irritating fact, but being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
a fact had to be accepted. As a man he was
entitled to an off day or two&ndash;&ndash;possibly to an
off week.</p>
<p>But when the second and third and fourth
week passed without any notable improvement
in him, Miss Winthrop became worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to put him wise,&#8221; she ventured
to suggest to Powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; Powers had inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he seems like a pretty decent sort,&#8221;
she answered indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he is,&#8221; admitted Powers, with an indifference
that was decidedly more genuine
than her own. It was quite clear that Powers&#8217;s
interest went no further. He had a wife and
two children and his own ambitions.</p>
<p>For a long time she saw no more of him
than she saw of Blake. He nodded a good-morning
when he came in, and then seemed to
lose himself until noon. Where he lunched she
did not know. For a while she had rather
looked for him, and then, to cure herself of
that, had changed her own luncheon place.
At night he generally hurried out early&ndash;&ndash;a
bad practice in itself: at least once, Farnsworth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
had wanted him for something after he was
gone; he had made no comment, but it was the
sort of thing Farnsworth remembered. When,
on the very next day, Mr. Pendleton started
home still earlier, it had required a good deal
of self-control on her part not to stop him. But
she did not stop him. For one thing, Blake
was at his desk at the time.</p>
<p>It was a week later that Miss Winthrop was
called into the private office of Mr. Seagraves
one afternoon. His own stenographer had been
taken ill, and he wished her to finish the day.
She took half a dozen letters, and then waited
while Farnsworth came in for a confidential
consultation upon some business matters. It
was as the latter was leaving that Mr. Seagraves
called him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Pendleton getting along?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop felt her heart stop for a beat
or two. She bent over her notebook to conceal
the color that was burning her cheeks. For an
impersonal observer she realized they showed
too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he has ability,&#8221; Farnsworth answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
slowly. &#8220;He began well, but he has let
down a little lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; answered Mr. Seagraves.
&#8220;I thought he would make a good man for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell better in another month,&#8221; Mr.
Farnsworth answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need another selling man,&#8221; declared
Mr. Seagraves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; nodded Farnsworth. &#8220;I have my
eye on several we can get if Pendleton doesn&#8217;t
develop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Ready, Miss Winthrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing Miss Winthrop had to decide that
night was whether she should allow Mr. Pendleton
to stumble on to his doom or take it
upon herself to warn him. She was forced to
carry that problem home with her, and eat
supper with it, and give up her evening to it.
Whenever she thought of it from that point of
view, she grew rebellious and lost her temper.
There was not a single sound argument why
her time and her thought should be thus monopolized
by Mr. Pendleton.</p>
<p>She had already done what she could for him,
and it had not amounted to a row of pins. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
had told him to go to bed at night, so that he
could get up in the morning fresh, and he had
not done it. She had advised him to hustle
whenever he was on an errand for Farnsworth,
and of late he had loafed. She had told
him to keep up to the minute on the current
investments the house was offering, and to-day
he probably could not have told even the names
of half of them. No one could argue that it
was her duty to keep after him every minute&ndash;&ndash;as
if he belonged to her.</p>
<p>And then, in spite of herself, her thoughts
went back to the private office of Mr. Seagraves.
She recalled the expression on the faces
of the two men&ndash;&ndash;an expression denoting only
the most fleeting interest in the problem of Mr.
Pendleton. If he braced up, well and good; if
he did not, then it was only a question of selecting
some one else. It was Pendleton&#8217;s affair,
not theirs.</p>
<p>That was what every one thought except
Pendleton himself&ndash;&ndash;who did not think at all,
because he did not know. And if no one told
him, then he would never know. Some day
Mr. Farnsworth would call him into the office
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and inform him his services were no longer
needed. He would not tell him why, even if
Don inquired. So, with everything almost
within his grasp, Pendleton would go. Of
course, he might land another place; but it
was no easy thing to find the second opportunity,
having failed in the first.</p>
<p>Yet this was all so unnecessary. Mr. Pendleton
had in him everything Farnsworth
wanted. If the latter could have heard him
talk as she had heard him talk, he would have
known this. Farnsworth ought to send him
out of the office&ndash;&ndash;let him get among men
where he could talk. And that would come
only if Mr. Pendleton could hold on here long
enough. Then he <i>must</i> hold on. He must cut
out his late hours and return to his old schedule.
She must get hold of him and tell him.
But how?</p>
<p>The solution came the next morning. She
decided that if she had any spare time during
the day she would write him what she had to
say. When she saw him drift in from lunch at
twenty minutes past one, she took the time
without further ado. She snatched a sheet of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
office paper, rolled it into the machine, snapped
the carriage into position, and began.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='lalign'><span class='smcap'>MR. DONALD PENDLETON</span>,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Care Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves,<br />
<span class='indent8'>&nbsp;</span>New York, N.Y.</p>
<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Of course it is none of my business whether you
get fired or not; but, even if it isn&#8217;t, I like to see
a man have fair warning. Farnsworth doesn&#8217;t
think that way. He gives a man all the rope he
wants and lets him hang himself. That is just
what he&#8217;s doing with you. I had a tip straight
from the inside the other day that if you keep on
as you have for the last six weeks you will last
here just about another month. That isn&#8217;t a
guess, either; it&#8217;s right from headquarters.</p>
<p>For all I know, this is what you want; but if it
is, I&#8217;d rather resign on my own account than be
asked to resign. It looks better, and helps you
with the next job. Most men downtown have a
prejudice against a man who has been fired.</p>
<p>You needn&#8217;t ask me where I got my information,
because I won&#8217;t tell you. I&#8217;ve no business to
tell you this much. What you want to remember
is that Farnsworth knows every time you get in
from lunch twenty minutes late, as you did to-day;
and he knows when you get in late in the
morning, as you have eleven times now; and he
knows when you take an hour and a half for a
half-hour errand, as you have seven times; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
knows when you&#8217;re in here half-dead, as you&#8217;ve
been all the time; and he knows what you don&#8217;t
know about what you ought to know. And no one
has to tell him, either. He gets it by instinct.</p>
<p>So you needn&#8217;t say no one warned you, and
please don&#8217;t expect me to tell you anything more,
because I don&#8217;t know anything more. I am,</p>
<p class='ralign'>Respectfully yours,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>SARAH K. WINTHROP</span>.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>She addressed this to the Harvard Club,
and posted it that night on her way home. It
freed her of a certain responsibility, and so
helped her to enjoy a very good dinner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>IN REPLY</h3>
</div>
<p>Don did not receive Miss Winthrop&#8217;s letter
until the following evening. He had dropped
into the club to join Wadsworth in a bracer,&ndash;&ndash;a
habit he had drifted into this last month,&ndash;&ndash;and
opened the envelope with indifferent interest,
expecting a tailor&#8217;s announcement. He
caught his breath at the first line, and then read
the letter through some five times. Wadsworth,
who was waiting politely, grew impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to learn that by heart&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
he began.</p>
<p>Don thrust the letter into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it
was rather important.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat down in the lounge.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yours?&#8221; inquired Wadsworth, as in
response to a bell a page came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little French vichy,&#8221; answered Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, have a real drink,&#8221; Wadsworth urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better not to-night,&#8221; answered
Don.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>Wadsworth ordered a cock-tail for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the market to-day?&#8221; he inquired.
He always inquired how the market was of his
business friends&ndash;&ndash;as one inquires as to the
health of an elderly person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you&#8217;ve cut out business?&#8221;
exclaimed Wadsworth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I have,&#8221; Don answered vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of retiring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I hadn&#8217;t thought of it
until very lately; but now&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don restrained a desire to read his letter
through once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take my advice and do it,&#8221; nodded Wadsworth.
&#8220;Nothing in it but a beastly grind.
It&#8217;s pulling on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Don had lost some five
pounds in the last month, and it showed in his
face. But it was not business which had done
that, and he knew it. Also Miss Winthrop
knew it.</p>
<p>It was certainly white of her to take the
trouble to write to him like this. He wondered
why she did. She had not been very much in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
his thoughts of late, and he took it for granted
that to the same degree he had been absent
from hers. And here she had been keeping
count of every time he came in late. Curious
that she should have done that!</p>
<p>In the library, he took out the letter and read
it through again. Heavens, he could not allow
himself to be discharged like an unfaithful
office-boy! His father would turn in his grave.
It would be almost as bad as being discharged
for dishonesty.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;s lips came together in thin lines. This
would never do&ndash;&ndash;never in the world. As Miss
Winthrop suggested, he had much better resign.
Perhaps he ought to resign, anyway. No matter
what he might do in the future, he could not redeem
the past; and if Farnsworth felt he had
not been playing the game right, he ought to
take the matter in his own hands and get off the
team. But, in a way, that would be quitting&ndash;&ndash;and
the Pendletons had never been quitters. It
would be quitting, both inside the office and
out. He had to have that salary to live on.
Without it, life would become a very serious
matter. The more he thought of this, the more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
he realized that resigning was out of the question.
He really had no alternative but to make
good; so he <i>would</i> make good.</p>
<p>The resolution, in itself, was enough to brace
him. The important thing now was, not to
make Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves understand
this, not to make Farnsworth understand this:
it was to make Miss Winthrop understand it.
He seized a pen and began to write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>MY DEAR SARAH K. WINTHROP</span> [he began]:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Farnsworth ought to be sitting at your desk
plugging that machine, and you ought to be holding
down his chair before the roll-top desk. You&#8217;d
get more work out of every man in the office in a
week than he does in a month. Maybe he knows
more about bonds than you do, but he doesn&#8217;t
know as much about men. If he did he&#8217;d have
waded into me just the way you did.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying Farnsworth hasn&#8217;t good cause
to fire me. He has, and that&#8217;s just what you&#8217;ve
made clear. But, honest and hope to die, I didn&#8217;t
realize it until I read your letter. I knew I&#8217;d been
getting in late and all that; but, as long as it
didn&#8217;t seem to make any difference to any one, I
couldn&#8217;t see the harm in it. I&#8217;d probably have
kept on doing it if you hadn&#8217;t warned me. And
I&#8217;d have been fired, and deserved it.</p>
<p>If that had happened I think my father would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
have risen from his grave long enough to come
back and disown me. He was the sort of man I
have a notion you&#8217;d have liked. He&#8217;d be down to
the office before the doors were open, and he&#8217;d
stay until some one put him out. I guess he was
born that way. But I don&#8217;t believe he ever stayed
up after ten o&#8217;clock at night in his life. Maybe
there wasn&#8217;t as much doing in New York after
ten in those days as there is now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to make any excuses, but, true as
you&#8217;re living, if I turned in at ten I might just as
well set up business in the Fiji Islands. It&#8217;s about
that time the evening really begins. How do you
work it yourself? I wish you&#8217;d tell me how you
get in on time, looking fresh as a daisy. And what
sort of an alarm-clock do you use? I bought one
the other day as big as a snare-drum, and the
thing never made a dent. Then I tried having
Nora call me, but I only woke up long enough to
tell her to get out and went to sleep again. If your
system isn&#8217;t patented I wish you&#8217;d tell me what
it is. In the mean while, I&#8217;m going to sit up all
night if I can&#8217;t get up any other way.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m going to make the office of Carter,
Rand &amp; Seagraves on time, beginning to-morrow
morning. You watch me. And I&#8217;ll make up for
the time I&#8217;ve overdrawn on lunches by getting
back in twenty minutes after this. As for errands&ndash;&ndash;you
take the time when Farnsworth sends me
out again.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re dead right in all you said, and if I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
make good in the next few months I won&#8217;t wait
for Farnsworth to fire me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll fire myself. But
that isn&#8217;t going to happen. The livest man in
that office is going to be</p>
<p class='ralign'>Yours truly,<span class='rindent14'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Donald Pendleton, Jr.</span><span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don addressed the letter to the office, mailed
it, and went home to dress. But before going
upstairs he called to Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know that I&#8217;m in
business now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t like to see me fired,
would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, sir!&#8221; gasped Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you get me up to-morrow morning at
seven o&#8217;clock, because if I&#8217;m late again that is
just what is going to happen. And you know
what Dad would say to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Don stepped briskly into
the office five minutes ahead of Miss Winthrop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>COST</h3>
</div>
<p>It was quite evident that Farnsworth had
something in mind; for, beginning that week, he
assigned Don to a variety of new tasks&ndash;&ndash;to
checking and figuring and copying, sometimes
at the ticker, sometimes in the cashier&#8217;s cage of
the bond department, sometimes on the curb.
For the most part, it was dull, uninspiring
drudgery of a clerical nature, and it got on
Don&#8217;s nerves. Within a month he had reached
the conclusion that this was nothing short of a
conspiracy on Farnsworth&#8217;s part to tempt him
to resign. It had the effect of making him hold
on all the more tenaciously. He did his work
conscientiously, and&ndash;&ndash;with his lips a little
more tightly set than was his custom&ndash;&ndash;kept
his own counsel.</p>
<p>He had no alternative. His new work gave
him little opportunity to talk with Miss Winthrop,
and she was the one person in the world
in whom he felt he could confide safely and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
length. She herself was very busy. Mr. Seagraves,
having accidentally discovered her ability,
was now employing her more and more in
his private office.</p>
<p>It was about this time that a lot of petty outside
matters came up, further to vex him. Up
to this point Don&#8217;s wardrobe had held out fairly
well; but it was a fact that he needed a new
business suit, and a number of tailors were
thoughtfully reminding him that, with March
approaching, it was high time he began to consider
seriously his spring and summer outfit.
Until now such details had given him scarcely
more concern than the question of food in his
daily life. Some three or four times a year, at
any convenient opportunity, he strolled into his
tailor&#8217;s and examined samples at his leisure.
Always recognizing at sight just what he
wanted, no great mental strain was involved.
He had merely to wave his cigarette toward any
pleasing cloth, mention the number of buttons
desired on coat and waistcoat, and the matter
was practically done.</p>
<p>But when Graustein &amp; Company announced
to him their new spring importations, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
dropped in there one morning on his way downtown,
he recognized the present necessity of
considering the item of cost. It was distinctly
a disturbing and embarrassing necessity, which
Mr. Graustein did nothing to soften. He looked
his surprise when Don, in as casual a fashion as
possible, inquired:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you charge for making up this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have long had an account with
us!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Here is something here,
Mr. Pendleton,&ndash;&ndash;an exclusive weave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Don firmly; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
that. But this other&ndash;&ndash;you said you&#8217;d make
that for how much?&#8221;</p>
<p>Graustein appeared injured. He waved his
hand carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty dollars,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You really
need two more, and I&#8217;ll make the three for two
hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I will tell you when to go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to have plenty of time on your
work, Mr. Pendleton,&#8221; said Graustein.</p>
<p>Two hundred dollars! Once upon the street
again, Don caught his breath. His bill at
Graustein&#8217;s had often amounted to three times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
that, but it had not then come out of a salary of
twenty-five dollars a week. Without extra expenses
he seldom had more than a dollar left on
Saturday. By the strictest economy, he figured,
it might be possible to save five. To pay a bill of
two hundred dollars would at that rate require
forty working weeks. By then the clothes
would be worn out.</p>
<p>It was facts like these that brought home to
Don how little he was earning, and that made
that ten-thousand-dollar salary appear like an
actual necessity. It was facts like these that
helped him to hold on.</p>
<p>But it was also facts like these that called his
attention to this matter of cost in other directions.
Within the next two months, one item
after another of his daily life became reduced
to figures, until he lived in a world fairly bristling
with price-tags. Collars were so much
apiece, cravats so much apiece, waistcoats and
shoes and hats so much. As he passed store
windows the price-tags were the first thing he
saw. It seemed that everything was labeled,
even such articles of common household use as
bed-linen, chairs and tables, carpets and draperies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
When they were not, he entered and
asked the prices. It became a passion with him
to learn the cost of things.</p>
<p>It was toward the middle of May that
Frances first mentioned a possible trip abroad
that summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolly Seagraves is going, and wishes me to
go with her,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a lot of money,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>One idle evening he had figured the cost of
the wedding trip they had proposed. He estimated
it at three years&#8217; salary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the tickets and hotel bills&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he
began.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Don, dear,&#8221; she protested mildly, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t expect you to pay my expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to Heavens I could, and go with
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had planned on June, hadn&#8217;t we?&#8221; she
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;On June,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>She patted his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old Don! Well, I think a fall wedding
would be nicer, anyway. And Dolly has an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
English cousin or something who may have us
introduced at court. What do you think of
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have you right here. I thought
after the season here I might be able to see
more of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d stay in
town all summer? Don, dear, I think you&#8217;re
getting a little selfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d be in town part of the summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall sail early, in order to have some
gowns made. But if you could meet us there for
a few weeks&ndash;&ndash;you do have a vacation, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two weeks, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, then you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy smoke, do you know what a first-class
passage costs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know. Then you couldn&#8217;t
go, anyway, could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you miss me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That will be nice, and I shall send you a
card every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;If your
father would only go broke before then. If only
he would!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuyvesant did not go broke, and Frances
sailed on the first of June. Don went to the
boat to see her off, and the band on the deck
played tunes that brought lumps to his throat.
Then the hoarse whistle boomed huskily, and
from the Hoboken sheds he watched her until
she faded into nothing but a speck of waving
white handkerchief. In twenty minutes he
was back again in the office of Carter, Rand &amp;
Seagraves&ndash;&ndash;back again to sheets of little
figures with dollar signs before them. These he
read off to Speyer, who in turn pressed the
proper keys on the adding-machine&ndash;&ndash;an endless,
tedious, irritating task. The figures ran to
hundreds, to thousands, to tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more uninteresting,
nothing more meaningless. He could not even
visualize the sums as money. It was like adding
so many columns of the letter &#8220;s.&#8221; And yet, it
was the accident of an unfair distribution of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
these same dollar signs that accounted for the
fact that Frances was now sailing out of New
York harbor, while he remained here before this
desk.</p>
<p>They represented the week&#8217;s purchase of
bonds, and if the name &#8220;Pendleton, Jr.,&#8221; had
appeared at the head of any of the accounts he
might have been by her side.</p>
<p>Something seemed wrong about that. Had
she been a steam yacht he could have understood
it. Much as he might have desired a
steam yacht, he would have accepted cheerfully
the fact that he did not have the wherewithal to
purchase it. He would have felt no sense of
injustice. But it scarcely seemed decent to consider
Frances from this point of view, though a
certain parallel could be drawn: her clean-cut
lines, her nicety of finish, a certain air of silver
and mahogany about her, affording a basis of
comparison; but this was from the purely artistic
side. One couldn&#8217;t very well go further
and estimate the relative initial cost and
amount for upkeep without doing the girl an
injustice. After all, there was a distinction
between a gasolene engine and a heart, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
matter how close an analogy physicians might
draw.</p>
<p>And yet, the only reason he was not now with
her was solely a detail of bookkeeping. It was
a matter of such fundamental inconsequence as
the amount of his salary. He was separated
from her by a single cipher.</p>
<p>But that cipher had nothing whatever to do
with his regard for her. It had played no part
in his first meeting with her, or in the subsequent
meetings, when frank admiration had developed
into an ardent attachment. It had nothing
to do with the girl herself, as he had seen
her for the moment he succeeded in isolating
her in a corner of the upper deck before she
sailed. It had nothing to do with certain moments
at the piano when she sang for him. It
had nothing to do with her eyes, as he had seen
them that night she had consented to marry
him. To be sure, these were only detached
moments which were not granted him often;
but he had a conviction that they stood for
something deeper in her than the everyday
moments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A MEMORANDUM</h3>
</div>
<p>During that next week Don found a great
deal of time in which to think. He was surprised
at how much time he had. It was as if
the hours in the day were doubled. Where
before he seldom had more than time to hurry
home and dress for his evening engagements, he
now found that, even when he walked home, he
was left with four or five idle hours on his hands.</p>
<p>If a man is awake and hasn&#8217;t anything else
to do, he must think. He began by thinking
about Frances, and wondering what she was
doing, until young Schuyler intruded himself,&ndash;&ndash;Schuyler,
as it happened, had taken the same
boat, having been sent abroad to convalesce
from typhoid,&ndash;&ndash;and after that there was not
much satisfaction in wondering what she was
doing. He knew how sympathetic Frances
was, and how good she would be to Schuyler
under these circumstances. Not that he mistrusted
her in the least&ndash;&ndash;she was not the kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
to lose her head and forget. But, at the same
time, it did not make him feel any the less lonesome
to picture them basking in the sun on the
deck of a liner while he was adding innumerable
little figures beneath an electric light in the rear
of the cashier&#8217;s cage in a downtown office. It
did not do him any good whatever.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion of such uneasy
wondering was to force him back to a study of
the investment securities of Carter, Rand &amp;
Seagraves. Right or wrong, the ten thousand
was necessary, and he must get it. On the
whole, this had a wholesome effect. For the
next few weeks he doubled his energies in
the office. That this counted was proved by
a penciled note which he received at the club
one evening:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Mr. Donald Pendleton.</span></p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Sir:&ndash;&ndash;</span></p>
<p>You&#8217;re making good, and Farnsworth knows it.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Sincerely yours,<span class='rindent16'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Sarah Kendall Winthrop</span>.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To hear from her like this was like meeting
an old friend upon the street. It seemed to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
that in all these last three weeks, when he
thought he was occupying the city of New
York all by himself, she, as a matter of fact,
had been sharing it with him. She too had
been doing her daily work and going home
at night, where presumably she ate her dinner
and lived through the long evenings right
here in the same city. He seldom caught a
glimpse of her even in the office now, for
Seagraves took all her time. Her desk had
been moved into his office. Yet, she had been
here all the while. It made him feel decidedly
more comfortable.</p>
<p>The next day at lunch-time Don waited outside
the office for her, and, unseen by her,
trailed her to her new egg sandwich place. He
waited until she had had time to order, and
then walked in as if quite by accident. She was
seated, as usual, in the farthest corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello,&#8221; he greeted her.</p>
<p>She looked up in some confusion. For several
days she had watched the entrance of every
arrival, half-expecting to see him stride in. But
she no longer did that, and had fallen back into
the habit of eating her lunch quite oblivious of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
all the rest of the world. Now it seemed like
picking up the thread of an old story, and she
was not quite sure she desired this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>There was an empty seat next to hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you hold that for me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t let you reserve seats here,&#8221; she
told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;d better not take a chance,&#8221;
he said, as he sat down in it.</p>
<p>He had not changed any in the last few
months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to go and get your lunch
for you?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he assured her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to
get any lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was mighty glad to get your note,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;I was beginning to think I&#8217;d got lost
in the shuffle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought Mr. Farnsworth had forgotten
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did. I hadn&#8217;t laid eyes on him for a
week.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Farnsworth never forgets,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any one else worth speaking of
in that office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m one of those not worth speaking of,&#8221;
she replied.</p>
<p>She met his eyes steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seagraves doesn&#8217;t seem to feel that way.
He keeps you in there all the time now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way he does his office desk,&#8221; she
nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;d better get your lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lose my chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, get your sandwich; I&#8217;ll hold the chair
for you,&#8221; she answered impatiently.</p>
<p>He rose immediately, and soon came back
with his plate and coffee-cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know I haven&#8217;t had one of these
things or a chocolate &eacute;clair since the last time I
was in one of these places with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>have</i> you been eating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doughnuts and coffee, mostly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t nearly so good for you,&#8221; she
declared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>He adjusted himself comfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like getting back home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke the word with a frightened, cynical
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s more like home than eating alone
at the other places,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all alike,&#8221; she returned&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;just
places in which to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said it with some point, but he did not
see the point. He took a bite of his egg sandwich.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, this tastes pretty good,&#8221; he assured
her.</p>
<p>He was eating with a relish and satisfaction
that he had not known for a long time. It was
clear that the credit for this was due in some
way to Sarah Kendall Winthrop, though that
was an equally curious phenomenon. Except
that he had, or assumed, the privilege of talking
to her, she was scarcely as intimate a feature of
his life as Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like your new work?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fierce,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s mostly
arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It all helps,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All you have to do
now is just to keep at it. Keeping posted on the
bonds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But as fast as I learn a new one, it&#8217;s
sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;The more
you learn, the better. Some day Mr. Farnsworth
will call you in and turn you loose on
your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, if you keep going. But you can&#8217;t
let up&ndash;&ndash;not for one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can only last through the summer,&#8221;
he reflected aloud. &#8220;Have you ever spent a
summer in town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where else would I spend a summer?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the mountains myself. Ever been to
Fabyan House?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked to see if he was joking. He was
not. He had spent the last three summers very
pleasantly in the White Mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;A ten-cent trolley
trip is my limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere I can find trees or water. You
can get quite a trip right in Central Park, and
it&#8217;s good fun to watch the kiddies getting an
airing.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a note in her voice that made him
turn his head toward her. The color sprang
to her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time I was getting back,&#8221; she announced
as she rose. &#8220;This is Mr. Seagraves&#8217;s
busy day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here; I haven&#8217;t finished my
&eacute;clair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better devote the next five minutes
to that,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>She disappeared through the door, and in
another second was blended with a thousand
others.</p>
<p>Don drew out his memorandum book and
made the following entry:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Visit Central Park some day and watch
the kiddies.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>ON THE WAY HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>Frances wrote him enthusiastically from London.
In her big, sprawling handwriting the
letter covered eight pages. Toward the end
she added:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I miss you quite a lot, Don, dear, especially on
foggy days. Please don&#8217;t work too hard, and
remember that I am, as always,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your     <span class='smcap'>FRANCES</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that was something to know&ndash;&ndash;that
she was always his, even in London. London
was a long way from New York, and of
course he could not expect her to go abroad
and then spend all her time writing to him.
He went up to the club after reading this, and
wrote her a letter twenty pages long. It was a
very sentimental letter, but it did him good.
The next day he returned to the office decidedly
refreshed. In fact, he put in one of the
best weeks there since he had taken his position.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
When Saturday came he was sorry that
it was a half-holiday: he would have liked to
work even through Sunday.</p>
<p>He left the office that day at a little before
twelve, and stood on the corner waiting for
Miss Winthrop. They had lunched together
every day during the week; but he had not
mentioned meeting her to-day, because he had
come to the conclusion that the only successful
way to do that was to capture her. So she
came out quite jauntily and confidently, and
almost ran into him as he raised his hat.</p>
<p>She glanced about uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please&ndash;&ndash;we mustn&#8217;t stand here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll walk a little way with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he accompanied her to the Elevated
station, and then up the steps, and as near as
she could judge purposed entering the train
with her. He revealed no urgent business.
He merely talked at random, as he had at
lunch.</p>
<p>She allowed two trains to pass, and then
said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go home now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me you are always on the point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
of going home,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;What do you
do after you get there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great many things to do,&#8221; she
informed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I have dinner too,&#8221; he nodded.
&#8220;Then what do you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great many things to do,&#8221; she
repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything to do after dinner,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I just wander around until it&#8217;s time
to go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a waste of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. It&#8217;s just killing time until the
next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She appeared interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have many friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all in London and Paris,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You see, I live all
alone. Dad left me a house, but&ndash;&ndash;well, he
didn&#8217;t leave any one in it except the servants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You live in a house all by yourself?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>Mr. Pendleton lived in a house! That was a
wonderful thing to her. She had almost forgotten
that any one lived in whole houses any
more. She was eager to hear more. So, when
the next train came along she stepped into it,
and he followed, although she had not intended
to allow this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would tell me about your house,&#8221;
she said wistfully.</p>
<p>So, on the way uptown, he tried to describe it
to her. He told her where it was, and that quite
took away her breath; and how his father had
bought it; and how many rooms there were; and
how it was furnished; and, finally, how he came
to be living in it himself on a salary of twenty-five
dollars a week. As she listened her eyes
grew round and full.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but you&#8217;re lucky!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I
should think you&#8217;d want to spend there every
minute you could get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just because it&#8217;s your house,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Just because it&#8217;s all your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And what do <i>you</i> want of ten thousand a
year?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;You can live like a
king on what you&#8217;re drawing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean you ought to give up trying for
the big jobs,&#8221; she said quickly. &#8220;You ought to
try all the harder for those, because that&#8217;s all
that&#8217;s left for you to try for. With everything
else provided, you ought to make a name for
yourself. Why, you&#8217;re free to work for nothing
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On twenty-five dollars a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a house that&#8217;s all your own. With a
roof over your head no one can take away, and
heat and light&ndash;&ndash;why, it&#8217;s a fortune and your
twenty-five so much extra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have to eat,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you have to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And wear clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was doing that and paying her rent out of
fifteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you do with all your
money,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>At this point she stepped out of the train, and
he followed her. She went down the stairs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the street, and he continued to follow. She was
on her way to the delicatessen store to buy
her provisions for the night and Sunday. Apparently
it was his intention to go there with
her. At the door of the little shop she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in here,&#8221; she informed him, as if
that concluded the interview.</p>
<p>He merely nodded and opened the door for
her. She was beginning to be worried. At this
rate there was no knowing but what he might
follow her right home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to buy my provisions for to-morrow,&#8221;
she further informed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I must get something too,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I buy it here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a public place,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they entered together, and Hans greeted
them both with a smile, as if this were the most
natural thing in the world. But Miss Winthrop
herself was decidedly embarrassed. This
seemed a very intimate business to be sharing
with a man. On the other hand, she did not
propose to have her plans put out by a man. So
she ordered half a pound of butter and a jar of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
milk and some cheese and some cold roast and
potato salad for that night and a lamb chop for
Sunday, and one or two other little things, the
whole coming to eighty-five cents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he asked, when she had concluded,
&#8220;what do you think <i>I&#8217;d</i> better order?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheeks were flushed, and she knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>He saw some eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well have a dozen eggs to start
with,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there only yourself?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should think a half-dozen would do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A half-dozen,&#8221; he corrected the order.</p>
<p>Then he thought of chops.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pound or two of chops,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have eggs for breakfast, you will need
chops only for dinner. Two chops will be
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she was through she had done practically
all his ordering for him,&ndash;&ndash;because she
could not bear to see waste,&ndash;&ndash;and the total
came to about one half what it usually cost him.
He thought there must be some mistake, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
insisted that Hans make a second reckoning.
The total was the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall trade with you altogether after
this,&#8221; he informed the pleased proprietor.</p>
<p>There were several packages, but Hans
bound them together into two rather large-sized
ones. With one of these in each hand, Don
came out upon the street with Miss Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home now,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are again!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you think I ought to go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here&ndash;&ndash;doesn&#8217;t it seem sort of foolish
to prepare two lunches in two different places.
Doesn&#8217;t it seem rather wasteful?&#8221;</p>
<p>Offhand, it did. And yet there was something
wrong with that argument somewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be wasteful, but it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; she
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, is it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we go
downtown somewhere and lunch together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go home with your bundles,&#8221; she
said, grasping at the most obvious fact she
could think of at the moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the only difficulty, I can call a
messenger,&#8221; he replied instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And lose all you&#8217;ve saved by coming &#8217;way
up here? I won&#8217;t listen to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go home with them and come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be too late for lunch then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take a taxi and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder your salary isn&#8217;t enough if you
do such things!&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;If you had
ten thousand a year, you would probably
manage to spend it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a doubt of it,&#8221; he answered cheerfully.
&#8220;On the other hand, it would get me out
of such predicaments as these.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently he was content to stand here in
front of the little shop the rest of the afternoon,
debating this and similar points. It was necessary
for her to take matters into her own
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sensible thing for you to do is to go
home and have lunch,&#8221; she decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t plan your whole day for you.
But you ought to get out in the sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll meet you in the park at three?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was upon the point of saying no, when
she made the mistake of meeting his eyes. They
were honest, direct, eager. It was so easy to
promise whatever they asked and so hard to be
always opposing them. She answered impulsively:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she paid for her impulse, as she generally
did, by being sorry as soon as she was out of
sight of him. The first thing she knew, she
would be back where she was a month ago, and
that would never do&ndash;&ndash;never do at all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A DISCOURSE ON SALARIES</h3>
</div>
<p>Until Miss Winthrop allowed Pendleton to
spend with her that afternoon in the park, the
period between the close of business on Saturday
and the opening on Monday had furnished
her with a natural protective barrier. On one
side of this stood the business world of Carter,
Rand &amp; Seagraves, to which Pendleton himself
belonged; on the other side was her own private,
personal world. Now that barrier was down.
Without realizing at the time the significance of
his request,&ndash;&ndash;a request so honestly and smilingly
made that it took her off her guard,&ndash;&ndash;she
had allowed him, for a period of a couple of
hours, to enter that personal world. By her side
he had explored with her the familiar paths in
the park which until then had been all her own.
He had made himself a part of them. Never
again could she follow them without, in a sense,
having him with her.</p>
<p>She realized this because when, at five o&#8217;clock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
she had told him to leave her at the foot of the
Elevated, she had watched him out of sight,
and then, instead of going home as she intended,
she had turned and gone back to the park. She
had a vague notion that she must put her life
back upon its normal basis before returning to
her room. If only for a few moments, she must
go over the old paths alone.</p>
<p>It was impossible. Everywhere she turned,
it was to recall some careless phrase or gesture
or expression of his&ndash;&ndash;to react to them again
exactly as when he had been with her. And this
man had nothing whatever to do with the office
of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves. She could not
force him back there; he insisted upon remaining
on the personal side of the barrier.</p>
<p>It was curious how quickly she accepted the
situation after her first startled surprise. After
all, if she was going to retain her interest in him
in any way, it was as necessary to help him outside
the office as within. One opportunity had
been offered her that very afternoon in making
him understand that it was perfectly possible
to enjoy a half-holiday without spending all the
money in his pocket.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>His attitude toward money puzzled her. In
one way he seemed to place too much value
upon it, and in another way not enough. He
overemphasized the importance of a ten-thousand-dollar
salary, making that the one goal of
his business efforts, and then calmly proposed
squandering dollar bills on confectionery and
what not as an incident to as simple an amusement
as a walk in the park. He neither knew
how little a dollar was worth, nor how much.
She herself had learned out of hard experience,
and if she could only make him understand&ndash;&ndash;well,
that at least furnished her with some sort
of excuse for allowing this new relationship to
continue.</p>
<p>For all any one knows, there may be some
divine reason that prompts women to find excuses
in such matters&ndash;&ndash;which, in a way, forces
them willy-nilly to the making of such excuses.</p>
<p>And yet, she had to admit that it was stretching
the excuse pretty far when, a week later, she
meekly allowed him to come with her on her
usual Sunday outing into the country. By
steady cross-examination he had made her divulge
the fact that it was her interesting habit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
to prepare a luncheon of bread and butter and
cake, and, taking a train, to spend the day by
the side of a brook she had discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;Next Sunday I&#8217;ll go
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That afternoon he started making his preparations.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing necessary was a
luncheon basket, and on his way uptown he
saw one of English wicker that took his fancy.
It had compartments with bottles and a whole
outfit of knives and forks and plates and little
drinking-cups and what not. What it cost is nobody&#8217;s
business. Then he stopped at a very nice
grocery store on Fifth Avenue and asked the
advice of the clerk about the more substantial
contents, and the clerk gave his advice very
willingly. He bought some French sardines and
English marmalade, and some fruit and confectionery
and some strictly fresh eggs and dainty
crackers and some jelly and olives and cheese
and several other little things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; suggested the clerk, &#8220;a small chicken
roasted and served cold would be very nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; nodded Don.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I could order it for you from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right again,&#8221; agreed Don.</p>
<p>It was to be sent to the house, so that Nora
could have it roasted that afternoon.</p>
<p>He accomplished these things on his way uptown,
and felt quite satisfied with himself. This
preparing of a picnic basket was, after all, a
very simple matter.</p>
<p>When Miss Winthrop came into the station
for the nine-thirty, he was waiting for her with
the big wicker basket in his hand.</p>
<p>They rode to a little village hardly large
enough to have a name, and getting out there
took to the open road.</p>
<p>Don enjoyed the tramp of three miles that
followed, but, on the whole, he was glad when
they reached the border of the brook. The
walking and the flowers and the scenery occupied
too much of the girl&#8217;s attention. Not only
that, but this English wicker basket became
heavy in the course of time. At the end of a
mile or so it seemed as if the clerk must have
lined the bottom of his basket with stones. Don
meant to investigate at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>The stream that she had discovered only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
after several seasons of ardent exploration was
not, geographically considered, of any especial
importance to the world at large. But behind
the clump of alders out of which it crept was
a bit of pasture greensward about as big as a
room. Here one might lunch in as complete
seclusion as if in the Canadian woods or in the
heart of Africa.</p>
<p>She was as eager to have him pleased as if
this were some house of her planning. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
better dining-place than any in town, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>With her permission, he lighted a cigarette
and, stretching himself out on the grass, enjoyed
it as only a man can who has limited his
smokes to so many a day. She sat near the
brook, and she too was quite content and very
comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you didn&#8217;t tell me about
this place before,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t quite sure you&#8217;d like it here, for
one thing,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a very gay place, is it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s considerably gayer than my house on a
Sunday,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own fault you don&#8217;t enjoy your
house more,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a wonderful thing to have a house
all of your own. I used to pretend this was a
house all of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you any longer?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was wondering how it would be about
that, now that she had allowed him to enter.
Of course, she might treat him merely as a
guest here; but that was difficult, because
the only thing she based her sense of ownership
on was the fact that no one else knew
anything about the place. She shook her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to pretend anything except when
you&#8217;re alone,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>He sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you oughtn&#8217;t to have let me come
here with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I help it? You just came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m always butting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
in, and you ought to tell me so every now
and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that make any difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as it would,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;But it might make me uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make you uncomfortable.
I think you manage to make yourself uncomfortable
enough, as it is. And that&#8217;s absurd,
because just being a man ought to keep you
happy all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you figure that,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a man is being able to do about anything
you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Having
money is the only thing that makes you able to
do what you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Are you going
back to that ten thousand a year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty soon now it will be September,&#8221; he
reflected irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had rather hoped to get it by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t, so you&#8217;d better forget it.
I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but what you received a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
raise to two thousand if Farnsworth gets you
out selling, and that ought to satisfy you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don looked up. Somehow, every time she
put it that way it did sound enough. Beside the
brook it sounded like plenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Would you
marry a man who was only drawing a salary of
two thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the question confused her, but
only for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was willing to take my chance with a
man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;his salary of two thousand
would be the least of my troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you think two could live on
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they could,&#8221; she answered shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And have enough to buy clothes and all
those things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And put money in the bank if they weren&#8217;t
two fools,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; he continued, clinging to
the subject when it was quite evident she was
willing to drop it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that hats cost
fifty dollars and more apiece, and gowns anywhere
from two hundred to five.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she nodded; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t they?&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember ever getting any bill of
that size,&#8221; she answered with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do your bills amount to?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to know,&#8221; she answered finally,
&#8220;this hat cost me some three dollars with the
trimmings. And if I ever paid more than
twenty-five dollars for a suit, I&#8217;d want some one
to appoint a guardian for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There certainly was a wide margin of difference
here in the estimates made by two women&ndash;&ndash;a
difference not accounted for, as far as Don
could see, in the visible results. He would have
liked to continue more into details, but Miss
Winthrop rose as if to put an end to this
subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;There&#8217;s my basket
over there, and I&#8217;ll let you set the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her idea had been that he was to eat his
luncheon and she hers. However, she had no
objection to making things ready for him. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
she brought the basket over in front of him and
opened it. She gave one look into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy all this?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She removed the napkin and saw the cold
chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know any better, or were you
just trying to see how much money you could
throw away?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like chicken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like chicken,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other things underneath, and hot
coffee in the bottles,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>Just to see how far he had gone, she took out
the other things. She caught her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your own affair,&#8221; she commented.
&#8220;But, if you eat all this, I&#8217;m sorry for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spread a napkin before him and placed
the chicken on it, surrounding it with the tin of
sardines, the boxes of crackers, the jar of marmalade,
the cheese, the confectionery, and
other things. Then she unrolled her own package
of sandwiches, and proceeded to munch one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t
think I bought this all for myself?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather think that than to think you
thought I was silly enough to want you to throw
away your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was carving the chicken, and he handed
her a portion upon one of the bright aluminum
plates. But she shook her head in refusal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to have any of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call that rather too bad, because if you
don&#8217;t it will be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was wasted when you bought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t tell me what to get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you we&#8217;d each bring our own luncheon,&#8221;
she reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so we did; but I don&#8217;t call it very
friendly of you not to share with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have quite enough of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed determined about the matter, so
he put all the things back again in the basket,
closed and fastened the lid, and, placing it to
one side, lighted a fresh cigarette. She watched
him in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to eat your lunch?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to eat alone.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one who is eating alone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to be what you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no right to do things and then
blame me for them,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing all the blaming yourself,&#8221; he
returned.</p>
<p>For a moment she continued to eat her sandwich
in silence and to watch his set face. She
was quite sure he would remain stubborn in the
stand he had taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was silly enough to buy all those expensive
things, but it would be even sillier to throw
them away,&#8221; she asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would at least be too bad,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t help it, can I? I can&#8217;t <i>make</i> you
eat, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>There he went again, placing the whole
blame on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand me that basket,&#8221; she ordered.</p>
<p>He handed her the basket, and she brought
out the delicacies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time I shall prepare both lunches,&#8221; she
declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be very nice,&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>Letter from Miss Frances Stuyvesant to Donald

<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>PARIS, FRANCE</span>, June 20.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>DEAR OLD DON</span>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m having a very good time, Don, dear, and I
know you&#8217;ll be glad to hear that. Dolly has a
great many friends in Paris, and so has Dad, and
so has Chic. Between them all we are very gay.
But it is raining to-day, and somehow I&#8217;ve been
worrying about your being in town with nothing
to do but work. I do hope you are taking care of
yourself and running to the shore or the mountains
for the week-ends.</p>
<p>Now I must hurry up and dress; but please
remember that I am still, as always,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>STARS</h3>
</div>
<p>At lunch one warm Wednesday, Don suggested
to Miss Winthrop that after the close of
business they take a car for the beach instead
of going to their respective homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can go down there, have our supper,
and then get out of the crowd and smell the
ocean awhile,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He had a knack for putting in a most reasonable
light anything he wished to do. It was a
feature of his selling gift, and she recognized it
as such.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221; he pressed her.</p>
<p>She blushed at her own hesitancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The incident remained uppermost in her
thoughts all the rest of the afternoon. If she
had known about this excursion the day before,
she would have put on a different shirt-waist.
She had a new silk waist which was very pretty
and which she had meant to wear next Sunday.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>He met her at the Elevated station, but it
was she who had to direct him to the proper
trolley for Coney, or they might have landed
anywhere along the Sound.</p>
<p>Stopping only long enough to buy an ice for
supper and a bag of peanuts, they sought the
beach. He threw himself down full length on
the sand, and she sat with her hands clasped
over her knees. The salt air swept her cheeks
and cooled them, and the waves before her ran
up the beach in play and song. This was certainly
a decided improvement over such a night
in her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;See those stars!&#8221; he exclaimed, as if this
were the first time he had ever seen them.</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes and looked at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I often look at them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then she laughed gently to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I do when I&#8217;m silly
enough to want jewels?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I take a look at those stars, and then I don&#8217;t
want jewels any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man could give away diamonds by the
handful if women would take that kind,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
exclaimed. &#8220;See that big fellow up there?&#8221;
He pointed it out, and she nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you that one,&#8221; he offered.</p>
<p>She laughed lightly&ndash;&ndash;confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t have to come to you or to any
one,&#8221; she reminded him. &#8220;I can just give it to
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t quite the same thing, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it was not quite the same thing. She
knew it. But she was not telling all she
knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me you&#8217;ve never married,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>She caught her breath. She had come to look
for unexpected remarks from him, but this was
a trifle more unexpected than usual. She tried
to laugh as she usually did, but she could not
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve figured out that, with all
your free diamonds, you&#8217;re better off as you
are,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the way of it?&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>She tried to make her voice natural, but
there was a tightening in her throat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done much figuring of any kind
along that line,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He was looking out to sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what both men and
women are better off unmarried,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>It was some one within her rather than she
herself who spoke. He turned to look at her,
but her eyes were out at sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if a man hasn&#8217;t much money?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her eyes again to the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has money to do with the stars?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think a man in my position has any
right to ask a woman to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has your position to do with it?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has a lot if the woman wants five times
what I&#8217;m earning,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She gave a little startled cry. The stars
swam before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You mean&ndash;&ndash;you mean
you&#8217;re thinking of some one like&ndash;&ndash;like that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>He had a vague notion this was not the sort
of thing one ordinarily discussed with another
woman. But Miss Winthrop was different from
other women: she had both experience and
common sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her to marry me a year ago,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>The stars were still swimming before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and she said&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she thought I ought to wait until I
was earning ten thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the reason you&ndash;&ndash;you wanted
the ten thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You didn&#8217;t think I wanted it for
myself, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>It was like a load removed from his shoulders.
He breathed freer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the most sensible woman I ever
met, and I thought you could help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hated that word sensible now, though
when Mr. Seagraves had used it to her it had
seemed like a compliment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I had plenty of money when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
were first engaged, and so it didn&#8217;t make any
difference, even if she had plenty too. Then,
when Dad tied up my share, why, it made things
different. We talked it over and decided that
ten thousand was about right; but&ndash;&ndash;well, I
didn&#8217;t think it would take so long to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is&ndash;&ndash;where is she now?&#8221; Miss Winthrop
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;She went abroad in June to stay until
September.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And left you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I couldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And left you here?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you get for being in business,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;We had planned to go
together&ndash;&ndash;on our honeymoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air was getting chill. She shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you warm enough?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>He started to remove his jacket to throw over
her shoulders, but she objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were silent a moment, and then she
said, almost complainingly:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As long as you couldn&#8217;t go, why didn&#8217;t she
stay here with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question startled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;In town?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t she stay here and look after
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she couldn&#8217;t do that when she was
going abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she had no business to go abroad,&#8221;
she answered fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; he put in. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t
married, you know. We&#8217;re only engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>why</i> aren&#8217;t you married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t true. You could afford it on half
what you&#8217;re earning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She should have married you, and if she
wanted more she should have stayed and
helped you get more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And helped?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>She was looking up at the stars again. They
were getting steadier.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way a woman can show&ndash;&ndash;she
cares.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>Then she rose. She was shivering again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better go now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t been here a half-hour,&#8221; he
protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here quite a long while,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Please, I want to go home now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p>An hour or so later Miss Winthrop lay in her
bed, where, with the door tight locked and the
gas out, she could feel just the way she felt like
feeling and it was nobody&#8217;s business. She cried
because she wished to cry. She cried because it
was the easiest and most satisfactory way she
knew of relieving the tenseness in her throat.
She burrowed her face in the pillow and cried
hard, and then turned over on her pig-tails and
sobbed awhile. It did not make any difference,
here in the dark, whether the tears made lines
down her face or not&ndash;&ndash;whether or not they
made her eyes red, and, worst of all, her nose
red.</p>
<p>From sobbing, Miss Winthrop dwindled to
sniveling, and there she stopped. She was not
the kind to snivel very long&ndash;&ndash;even by herself.
She did not like the sound of it. So she took her
wadded handkerchief and jammed it once into
each eye and jabbed once at each cheek, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
then, holding it tight in her clenched fist, made
up her mind to stop. For a minute or two an
occasional sob broke through spasmodically;
but finally even that ceased, and she was able
to stare at the ceiling quite steadily. By that
time she was able to call herself a little fool,
which was a very good beginning for rational
thinking.</p>
<p>There was considerable material upon which
to base a pretty fair argument along this line.
Admitting that Don Pendleton was what she
had been crying about,&ndash;&ndash;a purely hypothetical
assumption for the sake of a beginning,&ndash;&ndash;she
was able to start with the premise that a
woman was a fool for crying about any man.
Coming down to concrete facts, she found herself
supplied with even less comforting excuses.
If she had been living of late in a little fool&#8217;s
paradise, why, she had made it for herself. She
could not accuse him of having any other part
in it than that of merely being there. If she
went back a month, or three months, or almost
a year, she saw herself either taking the initiative
or, what was just as bad, passively submitting.
Of course, her motive had been merely to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
help him in an impersonal sort of way. She had
seen that he needed help, but she had not
dreamed the reason for it. She had no warning
that he had been deserted by her who should
have helped him. She had no way of knowing
about this other. Surely that ignorance was not
her fault.</p>
<p>Here is where she jabbed her handkerchief
again into each eye and lay back on her pig-tails
long enough to get a fresh grip upon herself.
Her skin grew hot, then cold, then hot
again. It really had all been more the fault of
this other than Mr. Pendleton&#8217;s. She had no
business to go away and leave him for some one
else to care for. She had no business to leave
him, anyway. She ought to have married him
away back when he first went to work to make
a fortune for her. Why didn&#8217;t she take the
money it cost to go to Europe and spend it on
him? She had let a whole year go wasted, when
she had such an opportunity as this! Here was
a house waiting for her; here was Don waiting
for her; and she had gone to Europe!</p>
<p>To put one&#8217;s self in another&#8217;s place&ndash;&ndash;in a
place of so delicate a nature as this&ndash;&ndash;is a dangerous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
business, but Miss Winthrop did not
do it deliberately. Lying there in the dark, her
imagination swept her on. The thought that
remained uppermost in her mind was the
chance this other girl had missed. She would
never have it again. In the fall Don would
receive his raise and be sent out to sell, and
after that his career was assured. It remained
only for him to hold steady&ndash;&ndash;an easy matter
after the first year&ndash;&ndash;and his income was bound
to increase by thousand-dollar jumps until he
won his ten thousand and more. And with that
there was not very much left, as far as she could
see, for a woman to do. The big fight would be
all over. A woman could no longer claim a
partnership; she would simply be bought.</p>
<p>If last fall she had had the chance of that
other, she would have had him out selling a
month ago. Give her a year or two, and she
would have him in that firm or some other.
She could do it. She felt the power that minute.</p>
<p>This raised a new question. What was she to
do from now on? Until now she had had the
excuse of ignorance; but there was still another
month before Don&#8217;s fianc&eacute;e would be back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
And this month would count a whole lot to him.
It was the deciding month. Farnsworth had
been watching him closely, and had about made
up his mind; but he was still on the alert for any
break. He had seen men go so far and then
break. So had she. It was common enough.
She herself had every confidence in Don, but
she was doubtful about how long it was wise to
leave even him alone. Men could not stand
being alone as well as women. They had not the
same experience. It took a special kind of
nerve to be alone and remain straight.</p>
<p>Well, supposing he did break, what was that
to her, now that she knew about this other?
Here was a perfectly fair and just question.
The man had made his selection and given over
his future into the care of the woman of his
choice, and she alone was responsible. There
could be no dispute about this. It was a fair
question; and yet, as soon as she framed it, she
recognized it as unworthy of her. Furthermore,
it led to an extremely dangerous deduction&ndash;&ndash;namely,
that her interest, after all, was not
entirely impersonal; for if it were what difference
did one woman or twenty other women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
make in her relations with him? To put the
matter bluntly, she was acting exactly as if she
were in love with him herself!</p>
<p>When Miss Winthrop faced that astounding
fact she felt exactly as if her heart stopped beating
for a full minute. Then it started again as if
trying to make up for the lapse in a couple of
breaths. She gasped for breath and, throwing
off the bedclothes, jumped up and lighted the
gas. Here was something to be met in the light.
But, as soon as she caught sight of her flushed
cheeks and her staring eyes, she hurriedly
turned out the gas again and climbed back into
bed. Here she lay like some trapped thing,
panting and helpless. Over and over again she
whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m not!&#8221; as if some
one were bending over her and taunting her
with the statement. Then she whispered, &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t true! Oh, it isn&#8217;t true!&#8221; She denied it
fiercely&ndash;&ndash;vehemently. She threw an arm over
her eyes even there in the dark.</p>
<p>It was such an absurd accusation! If she had
been one of those silly, helpless creatures with
nothing else to do in life but fall in love, it
might have had some point; but here she was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
a self-respecting, self-supporting girl who had
seen enough of men to know distinctly better
than to do anything so foolish. It had been the
confidence born of this knowledge that had allowed
her from the start to take an impersonal
interest in the man. And the proof of this was
that she had so conducted herself that he had
not fallen in love with her.</p>
<p>Then what in the world was she crying about
and making such a fuss about? She asked herself
that, and, with her lips firm together, determined
that the best answer was to do no
more crying and make no more fuss. So she
settled back again upon her pig-tails, and stared
at the ceiling and stared at the ceiling and
stared at the ceiling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE SENSIBLE THING</h3>
</div>
<p>When Miss Winthrop rose the next morning,
she scarcely recognized the woman she saw in
the glass as the woman she had glimpsed for a
second last night when she had risen and lighted
the gas. Her cheeks were somewhat paler than
usual, and her eyes were dull and tired. She
turned from the glass as soon as possible, and
donned a freshly laundered shirt-waist. Then
she swallowed a cup of coffee, and walked part
way to the office, in the hope that the fresh air
might do something toward restoring her color.
In this she was successful, but toward noon the
color began to fade again.</p>
<p>The problem that disturbed her the entire
morning long had to do with luncheon. She
recognized that here she must strike the keynote
to all her future relations with Mr. Pendleton.
If she was to eliminate him entirely and go
back to the time when he was non-existent, then
she must begin to-day. It was so she preferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
to handle disagreeable tasks. She detested
compromises. When she had anything to do,
she liked to do it at once and thoroughly. If she
had consulted her own wishes and her own interests
alone, she would never have seen him
again outside the office. But if she did this, what
would become of him during this next month?</p>
<p>The trouble was that Don would get lonesome&ndash;&ndash;not
necessarily for her, but for that
other. He was the sort of man who needed some
one around all the time to take an interest in
him. This deduction was based, not upon guesswork,
but upon experience. For almost a year
now she had seen him every day, and had
watched him react to just such interest on her
part. She was only stating a fact when she said
to herself that, had it not been for her, he
would have lost his position months before. She
was only stating another fact when she said to
herself that even now he might get side-tracked
into some clerical job. Give him a month to
himself now, and he might undo all the effort of
the last six months. Worse than that, he might
fall into the clutches of Blake and go to pieces
in another way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>There was not the slightest use in the
world in retorting that this, after all, was
the affair of Don and his fianc&eacute;e rather than
hers. She had brought him through so far,
and she did not propose to see her work
wasted. No one would gain anything by such
a course.</p>
<p>The alternative, then, was to continue to
meet him and to allow matters to go on as before.
It was toward the latter part of the forenoon
that she reached this conclusion. All this
while she had been taking letters from Mr. Seagraves
and transcribing them upon her typewriter
without an error. She had done no conscious
thinking and had reached no conscious
conclusion. All she knew was that in the early
forenoon she had been very restless, and that
suddenly the restlessness vanished and that she
was going on with her typewriting in a sort of
grim content. Half-past eleven came, and then
twelve. She finished the letter, and went for
her hat as usual, putting it on without looking
in the glass.</p>
<p>Don met her a little way from the office, and
she fell into step at his side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I was sort of worried about you last night,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You looked tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I was,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get a vacation before long?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could have had her vacation a month
ago, but there seemed to be no reason for
taking it. She had not been able to think of any
place to which she wished to go. Then she had
forgotten about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to take it next month,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>She decided that much on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there&#8217;s one due me, too,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Blake said something about it a while ago.
But I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do with a vacation
if I took one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you had something very important
to do with it,&#8221; she answered quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it for your wedding trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suggestion made him catch his breath.
&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;That means getting
married!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it does,&#8221; she nodded.</p>
<p>They had reached the little restaurant, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
she hurried in. Without waiting for his assistance,
she secured a cup of coffee and a sandwich
for herself. Then she found a chair and sat
down. She did not know how she was ever
going to swallow anything, but she had to have
something to do to occupy her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put that up to a man as if it were the
easiest thing in the world,&#8221; he observed, sitting
in the next chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is, isn&#8217;t it&ndash;&ndash;once you&#8217;ve made up
your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me as if it was one thing to make
up your mind to get married some day, and
another really to get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to do it than to waste your
time thinking about it,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;When
Farnsworth hands you that raise, believe me,
he&#8217;ll want you to have both feet on the
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t want you to be drifting in with
only three hours&#8217; sleep, the way you did most
of last winter. He has a lot more confidence
in married men, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don laughed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That phrase makes a man feel ten years
married.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been trying hard to eat her lunch,
but without much success. He noticed this.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t happen to be hungry, that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t catch cold last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>He went to the counter and returned with
some doughnuts for himself and a piece of cake
for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looked so good I thought you might
like it,&#8221; he said, as he placed it on the arm of her
chair. &#8220;It&#8217;s so much easier to talk when eating.
I want to hear more about this scheme of yours
for marrying me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly my suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You proposed it a minute ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I said was that if you mean to get married,
you&#8217;d better do it right away and be done
with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;During my vacation?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>She brought her lips together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, that rather appeals to me,&#8221;
he answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>She turned aside her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only sensible thing,&#8221; she assured
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would give a man a chance to settle down
and attend to business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And give his wife a chance to help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, I&#8217;m going to propose that to
Frances the day she lands!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>He was finishing his last doughnut. Miss
Winthrop rose. Once outside, she could breathe
freely. She said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her&ndash;&ndash;her name is Frances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frances Stuyvesant,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you expect her home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first of September.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better put in a bid to have your
vacation the first two weeks in September,&#8221;
she advised. &#8220;Business will begin to pick up
right after that, and Farnsworth will need you.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII_LOOKING_AHEAD' id='CHAPTER_XXIII_LOOKING_AHEAD'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>LOOKING AHEAD</h3>
</div>
<p>It was now the first week in August. If she
could sustain his interest in the project for three
weeks and get him married in the fourth, then
she could settle back into the routine of her life.
It was the only possible way of straightening
out the tangle. Once he was safely married,
that was the end. Their relations would cease
automatically. The conventions would attend
to that. As a married man he, of course, could
not lunch with her or spend Saturday afternoons
in the park with her, or Sunday in the
country with her, or mid-week evenings anywhere
with her. He would be exiled from her
life as effectively as if he himself should go to
Europe. In fact, the separation would be even
more effective, because there would not be any
possible hope of his coming back. For her it
would be almost as if he died.</p>
<p>Back in her room that night, Miss Winthrop
saw all these things quite clearly. And she saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
that this was the only way. In no other way
could she remain in the office of Carter, Rand &amp;
Seagraves. If he did not marry in September,&ndash;&ndash;she
had applied that afternoon for her own
vacation to parallel his,&ndash;&ndash;then she must resign.
Unmarried, he would be as irresponsible this
coming winter as he was last, and if she remained
would be thrown back upon her. She
could not allow that&ndash;&ndash;she could not endure
it.</p>
<p>She had lost so many things all at once. She
did not realize until now how much dreaming
she had done in these last few months. Dreams
of which at the time she had scarcely been conscious
returned to-night to mock her with
startling vividness. It was not so much that
she wished to be loved as that she wished to
love. That was where she had deceived herself.
Had Don made love to her, she would have
recognized the situation and guarded herself.
But this matter of loving him was an attack
from a quarter she had not anticipated.</p>
<p>In the next three weeks she left him little
chance to think of anything but of his work and
of Frances. She talked of nothing else at lunch;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
she talked of nothing else on Saturday afternoons
and on Sundays and whenever they met
on other days. This had its effect. It accustomed
him to associate together the two chief
objectives in his life until in his thoughts they
became synonymous. For the first time since
their engagement, he began to think of Frances
as an essential feature of his everyday affairs.</p>
<p>He began to think about what changes in the
house would be necessary before she came. He
talked this over with Miss Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you could come up and look the place
over before Frances gets here,&#8221; he said to her
one day.</p>
<p>If the color left her face for a second, it came
back the next with plenty to spare. The idea
was preposterous, and yet it appealed to her
strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; she answered sincerely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why can&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible&ndash;&ndash;of course,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could arrange a little dinner and ask some
one to chaperon,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of the question,&#8221; she answered
firmly. &#8220;You can tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But telling you about it isn&#8217;t like letting
you see it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost as good, and&ndash;&ndash;almost as good
is something, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a suppressed note in her voice that
made him look up. He had caught many such
notes of late. Sometimes, as now, he half expected
to find her eyes moist when he looked
up. He never did; he always found her
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have Nora give everything a thorough
cleaning before September,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>He wrote it down in his notebook, and that
night spoke to Nora about it. She appeared
decidedly interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible that in the fall you may have
some one else besides me to look after,&#8221; he
confided to her in explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to be soon, sir?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In September, perhaps,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would please your father, sir,&#8221; she answered
excitedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s lonesome it&#8217;s been for
you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer, but he thought about that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
a little. No, it had not been exactly lonesome
for him&ndash;&ndash;not lately. That was because he was
looking ahead. That was it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t seemed quite natural for you to
be living on here alone, sir,&#8221; she ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad lived here alone,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at your age, sir,&#8221; answered Nora.</p>
<p>From that moment there was much ado in
the house. Don came home at night to find
certain rooms draped in dusting clothes, later to
appear as fresh and immaculate as if newly
furnished. This gave him a great sense of responsibility.
He felt married already. He came
downtown in the morning a little more serious,
and took hold of his work with greater vigor.</p>
<p>The next few weeks passed rapidly. Frances
had finished her trip to Scotland and was on her
way back to London. She was to sail in a few
days now. He cabled her to let him know when
she started, and three days later she answered.
He showed her reply to Miss Winthrop.</p>
<p>Sail Monday on the Mauretania, but Dolly
wants me to spend next two weeks after arrival
in the Adirondacks with her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>Miss Winthrop returned the cable with a
none too steady hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;She mustn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; she said firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;You
see, she doesn&#8217;t know she is to be married
right away. Do you think I ought to cable her
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would,&#8221; Miss Winthrop
replied. &#8220;But I would let her know I didn&#8217;t
approve of her arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing I just say, &#8216;Have other plans for
you&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would do,&#8221; she nodded.</p>
<p>So he sent her this message, and that evening
at dinner Miss Winthrop spoke to him of another
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have shown much attention
to her parents this summer. Oughtn&#8217;t you
to see them and let them know what you
intend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Stuyvesant?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he object?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as he will. Then again he
might. You see, I&#8217;ve never told him just how
Dad tied things up.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;With the house and what you&#8217;re
earning, you have enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t as much as he expects a man to give
his daughter, though,&ndash;&ndash;not by a long shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Why, even
without the house it would be enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, with a smile. &#8220;When
you say it&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s enough. I wish Stuyvesant
knew you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood came into her cheeks. She wished
he wouldn&#8217;t say things like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me you ought to see him and
tell him,&#8221; she said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of seeing him until I&#8217;ve seen
Frances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all settled about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That she&#8217;ll marry me in September?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she answered excitedly. &#8220;Why,
she&#8217;s been waiting a whole year. Do you think
she&#8217;ll want to wait any longer? As soon as
she knows how well you&#8217;ve done, why&ndash;&ndash;why,
that&#8217;s the end of it. Of course that&#8217;s the end
of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish I were as confident as you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be,&#8221; she answered firmly. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t feel any other way. The house is all
ready, and you are all ready, and&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all
there is to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Frances is all ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When she promised to marry you she was
ready,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.
I guess women are different from men. They&ndash;&ndash;they
don&#8217;t make promises like that until they
are quite sure, and when they are quite sure
they are quite ready. This last year should
have been hers. You made a mistake, but
there&#8217;s no sense in keeping on with the mistake.
Oh, I&#8217;m quite sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was wearing a light scarf,&ndash;&ndash;this was at
Jacques&#8217;,&ndash;&ndash;and she drew it over her shoulders.
Somehow, the unconscious act reminded him of
a similar act on the beach at Coney....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>VACATIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>During this next week&ndash;&ndash;the week Frances
was on the ocean and sailing toward him&ndash;&ndash;he
gained in confidence day by day. Miss Winthrop
was so absolutely sure of her point of
view that it was difficult in her presence to have
any doubts.</p>
<p>Frances was due to arrive on Monday, and
for Sunday he had arranged at Jacques&#8217; a very
special little dinner for Miss Winthrop. Miss
Winthrop herself did not know how special it
was, because all dinners there with him were
special. There were roses upon the table. Their
odor would have turned her head had it not
been for the realization that her trunk was all
packed and that to-morrow morning she would
be upon the train. She had written to an aunt
in Maine that she was coming&ndash;&ndash;to this particular
aunt because, of the three or four she
knew at all, this aunt was the farthest from
New York.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>As for him, he had forgotten entirely that
Monday marked the beginning of her vacation.
That was partly her fault, because for the last
week she had neglected to speak of it.</p>
<p>Ordinarily she did not permit him to come
all the way back to the house with her; but this
night he had so much to talk about that she
did not protest. Yes, and she was too weak
to protest, anyway. All the things he talked
about&ndash;&ndash;his fears, his hopes, speculations, and
doubts&ndash;&ndash;she had heard over and over again.
But it was the sound of his voice to which she
clung. To-morrow and after to-morrow everything
would be changed, and she would never
hear him talk like this again. He was excited
to-night, and buoyant and quick with life. He
laughed a great deal, and several times he spoke
very tenderly to her.</p>
<p>They had reached her door, and something in
her eyes&ndash;&ndash;for the life of him he could not tell
what&ndash;&ndash;caused him to look up at the stars.
They were all there in their places.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at &#8217;em,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They seem nearer
to-night than I&#8217;ve ever seen them.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;I GUESS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT FROM MEN&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>She was a bit jealous of those stars. It had
been when with her that he had first seen
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t looking,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>She turned her eyes to the sky. To her they
seemed farther away than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Frances is looking at those same
stars,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She resented the suggestion. She turned her
eyes back to the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the star I gave you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lost it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; he chided her lightly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t call that very nice. You don&#8217;t have a star
given you every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I didn&#8217;t need to have them
given to me, because I could take all I wanted
myself. You don&#8217;t own the stars too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel to-night as if I did,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to pick out another for you.&#8221; He searched
the heavens for one that suited him. He found
one just beyond the Big Dipper, that shone
steadily and quietly, like her eyes. He pointed
it out to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you that one, and please don&#8217;t lose
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see it?&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>She was forced to look. After all, he could
afford to give her one out of so many, and it
would be something to remember him by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, with a break in her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That one is yours,&#8221; he assured her.</p>
<p>It was as if he added, &#8220;All the rest belong to
Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your star,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and
I wish you the best of luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her hand, but he was confused by the
note of finality in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any need of being so solemn
about saying good-night,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>He continued to hold her hand firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s good-bye and&ndash;&ndash;God-speed, too,&#8221;
she reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going on a long journey, and I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
going on a little journey.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You? Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t want her to go anywhere. He
wanted her to stay right where she was. Come
to think of it, he always wanted her to stay
right where she was. He always thought of her
as within reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;My vacation begins to-morrow,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re going away&ndash;&ndash;out of town?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Why,
I was depending upon you these next few
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was difficult for her to tell at the moment
whether the strain in her throat was joy or pain.
That he needed her&ndash;&ndash;that was joy; that he
needed her only for the next few days&ndash;&ndash;that
was not joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t depend upon any one these
next few days but yourself,&#8221; she answered
earnestly. &#8220;And after that&ndash;&ndash;just yourself and
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well enough if everything comes out
all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it come out right. That&#8217;s your privilege
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
as a man. Oh, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so good to
be a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have been a man yourself,&#8221;
he told her.</p>
<p>She caught her breath at that, and insisted
upon withdrawing her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to think I&#8217;d like to be,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>He had swung the talk back to her again,
when the talk should have been all of him and
Frances.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in you to get everything in the
world you want,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure of
that. All you have to do is to want it hard
enough. And now there are so many things
right within your grasp. You won&#8217;t let go of
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your home, your wife, and your work&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
wonderful to make good in so many things
all at once! So&ndash;&ndash;good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk as if you were not coming back
again!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming back to Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves&ndash;&ndash;if
that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re coming back here&ndash;&ndash;to your
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m coming back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll just say s&#8217;long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We must say good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had not wished to say this in so many
words. She had hoped he would take the new
situation for granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come back you must look on me as&ndash;&ndash;as
Mr. Farnsworth does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s very, very good sense. It&#8217;s the only
thing possible. Can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Frances will help you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t want to make a cad of me; I
know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the door behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t wait any longer. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was in the dark hall now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;long,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>Softly, gently, she closed the door upon him.
Then she stumbled up the stairs to her room,
and in the dark threw herself face down on her
bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>IN THE PARK</h3>
</div>
<p>Either Frances had grown more beautiful
in the last three months, or Don had forgotten
how really beautiful she was when she left; for,
when she stepped down the gangplank toward
him, he was quite sure that never in his life had
he seen any one so beautiful as she was then.
Her cheeks were tanned, and there was a foreign
touch in her costume that made her look more
like a lady of Seville than of New York. As she
bent toward him for a modest kiss, he felt for a
second as if he were in the center of some wild
plot of fiction. This was not she to whom he
was engaged,&ndash;&ndash;she whom he purposed to
marry within the week,&ndash;&ndash;but rather some
fanciful figure of romance.</p>
<p>He stepped into her car,&ndash;&ndash;he did not know
even if he was asked,&ndash;&ndash;and for a half-hour
listened to her spirited narration of incidents of
the voyage. It was mostly of people, of this
man and that, this woman and that, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
details of the weather and deck sports. Under
ordinary circumstances he might have enjoyed
the talk; but, with all he had to tell her, it
sounded trivial.</p>
<p>They reached the house. Even then, there
was much talk of trunks and other things of no
importance to him whatever. Stuyvesant hung
around in frank and open admiration of his
daughter; and Mrs. Stuyvesant beamed and
listened and stayed. Don had a feeling that,
in spite of his position in the family, they
looked upon him at this moment as an intruder.</p>
<p>It was another half-hour before he found
himself alone with her. She came to his side at
once&ndash;&ndash;almost as if she too had been awaiting
this opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old Don,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to see
you again. But you look tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you look beautiful!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Now that he was alone with her, he felt again
as he had at the steamer&ndash;&ndash;that this woman
was not she to whom he was engaged, but some
wonderful creature of his imagination. The
plans he had made for her became commonplace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
One could not talk over with her the
matter-of-fact details of marrying and of housekeeping
and of salaries. And those things that
yesterday had filled him with inspiration, that
had appeared to him the most wonderful things
in life, that had been associated with the stars,
seemed tawdry. She had been to London to see
the Queen, and the flavor of that adventure was
still about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, dear, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was so long silent that she was worried.
He passed his hand over his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered honestly.
&#8220;There were a lot of things I wanted to say to
you, and now I can&#8217;t think of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s the house,&#8221; he replied vaguely.
&#8220;I wish we could get out of here for a little
while. After lunch I want you to come to walk
with me. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an odd fancy!&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I get you all mixed up with your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
father and mother and the Queen,&#8221; he ran on.
&#8220;I want to talk to you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sounded more natural to her when he
talked like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Don, though there are a hundred
things I ought to do this afternoon. And I must
decide about going to the mountains with
Dolly. What <i>were</i> those other plans you cabled
me about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are what I want to talk over with
you,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they? I&#8217;m dying to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in the park. Now I&#8217;ll go, so
that you&#8217;ll have time to do some of the hundred
things you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her arms to him. He kissed her
lips. Then she seemed to come back to him as
she had been before she sailed. He could have
said all he wished to say then. But her mother
was calling her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here at two. And, this once&ndash;&ndash;you
must cancel every other engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>She came to the door with him, and stood
there until he turned the corner. He did not
know where to go, but unconsciously his steps
took him downtown. He stopped at a florist&#8217;s
and ordered a dozen roses to be sent back to the
house. He stopped to order a box of her favorite
bonbons. Then he kept on downtown toward
the office of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves. But
this was the first day of his vacation, and so he
had no object in going there. He must find a
place to lunch. He came to a dairy lunch, and
then he knew exactly what it was he needed.
He needed Sally Winthrop to talk over his
complication with him.</p>
<p>As he made his way to the counter for his
sandwich and coffee, he frowned. He had told
her that he would surely need her. Now she
was gone. He suddenly recalled that she had
not even left her address.</p>
<p>Only two days before he had been discussing
with her the final details of the house awaiting
Frances, and she had made him feel that everything
was perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will love it,&#8221; she had assured him.</p>
<p>It was as if he heard her voice again repeating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
that sentence. Once again he reacted to her
enthusiasm and saw through her eyes. She had
made him feel that money&ndash;&ndash;the kind of money
Stuyvesant stood for&ndash;&ndash;was nonsense. A salary
of twelve hundred a year was enough for the
necessities, and yet small enough to give his
wife an opportunity to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the big success comes,&#8221; she had said
to him, &#8220;then Frances can feel that it is partly
her success too. A woman doesn&#8217;t become a
wife by just marrying a man, does she? It&#8217;s
only when she has a chance to help that she can
feel herself really a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said it he felt that to be true, although
to him it was a brand-new point of view.</p>
<p>And Sally Winthrop had given him, in her
own life, a new point of view on woman. He
understood that she had never married because
she had never happened to fall in love. She had
always been too busy. But if ever she did fall in
love, what a partner she would make! Partner&ndash;&ndash;that
was the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in you to get everything in the world
you want,&#8221; she had said last night, when she
was leaving him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>So it was. He gulped down the rest of his
coffee and glanced at his watch. It was shortly
after one. He must stay down here another half-hour&ndash;&ndash;stay
around these streets where he had
walked with her and where she had made him
see straight&ndash;&ndash;until he had just time to meet
Frances.</p>
<p>He went out and walked past the office of
Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves, and then walked to
the Elevated station where she took the train at
night for home. The sight of the steps up which
they had climbed together made him almost
homesick. He wished to Heaven that she had
postponed her vacation another day. If only he
could see her a few minutes right now, he would
be absolutely sure of himself.</p>
<p>It was after two when he reached the house,
but Frances was not ready. She was never
quite ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait outside,&#8221; he told the maid.</p>
<p>The maid raised her brows a trifle, but answered
civilly:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he walked back and forth the Stuyvesant
machine also drew up before the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
waited. He viewed it with suspicion. He could
not say what he had to say in that. She must
be afoot, as Sally Winthrop always was.</p>
<p>He was making his turn at the end of the
street when she came down the steps and before
he could reach her stepped into the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have several little things to do after
we&#8217;ve had our walk,&#8221; she explained to Don, as
he came up.</p>
<p>She made room for him by her side. Because
he did not wish to argue before the chauffeur,
he took his allotted place; but he himself gave
the order to the driver:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Central Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we get there we must get out and
walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Don,&#8221; she submitted; &#8220;but I
think we&#8217;d be much more comfortable right
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She regarded him anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anything worrying you, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;If it&#8217;s because of
Jimmy Schuyler, you needn&#8217;t worry any more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
He was very nice at first, but later&ndash;&ndash;well, he
was too nice. You see, he forgot I was engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The little cad!&#8221; exclaimed Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t blame him too much. He just
forgot. And now he is very attentive to Dolly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She allows it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she rather likes him. She has invited
him up to camp. And, Don, dear, she
wants you to come too. It would be very nice
if we could all go. Can&#8217;t you manage it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t appeal to me just now,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>The machine had swung into the park. He
ordered the chauffeur to stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said to Frances.</p>
<p>He found the path from the drive where the
children played, and he found the bench where
he had sat with Sally Winthrop. Then all she
had told him came back to him, as it had in the
dairy lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the other plans I want to tell you
out here,&#8221; he began eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a lot of work while you were
away,&#8221; he said proudly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It seems a pity it was necessary,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been the best thing that ever happened
to me,&#8221; he corrected her. &#8220;It has made me see
straight about a lot of things. And it&#8217;s helped
me to make good in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ve been made a partner or
something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that&ndash;&ndash;yet,&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
pretty sure I&#8217;ll be put to selling when I come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on my vacation,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;This
is the first day of my vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you <i>can</i> come with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you came with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With you, Don? But where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere you wish, as long as we go together
and alone. Only we must get back in
two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it,&#8221; he went on earnestly. &#8220;I want
to marry you to-morrow or next day. Your
trunks are all packed, and you needn&#8217;t unpack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
them. We&#8217;ll spend all the time we can spare in
the mountains, and then come back&ndash;&ndash;to the
house. It&#8217;s all ready for you, Frances. It&#8217;s
waiting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared about in fear lest some one might
be overhearing his rambling talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don,&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora has cleaned every room,&#8221; he ran on,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve saved a hundred dollars for the trip.
And Farnsworth is going to give me a raise
before December. He hasn&#8217;t promised it, but I
know he&#8217;ll do it, because I&#8217;m going to make
good. You and I together will make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She could not. She was
left quite paralyzed. He was leaning forward
expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a full minute before she could answer.
Then she said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so impossible, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;doesn&#8217;t get married that
way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it matter how one gets married?&#8221;
he answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What would people say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they&#8217;d say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t get like that, Don, dear,&#8221; she
chided him. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s being an anarchist
or something, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just being yourself, little girl,&#8221; he explained
more gently. &#8220;The trouble with us is,
we&#8217;ve thought too much about other people
and&ndash;&ndash;other things. It&#8217;s certain that after
we&#8217;re married people aren&#8217;t going to worry
much about us, so why should we let them
worry us before that? No, it&#8217;s all our own affair.
As for the salary part of it, we&#8217;ve been
wrong about that, too. We don&#8217;t need so much
as we thought we did. Why, do you know you
can get a good lunch downtown for fifteen
cents? It&#8217;s a fact. You can get an egg sandwich,
a chocolate &eacute;clair, and a cup of coffee for
that. I know the place. And I&#8217;ve figured that,
with the house all furnished us, we can live easy
on twenty-five a week until I get more. You
don&#8217;t need your ten thousand a year. It&#8217;s a
fact, Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer, because she did not quite
know what he was talking about. Yet, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
blood was running faster. There was a new
light in his eyes&ndash;&ndash;a new quality in his voice
that thrilled her. She had never heard a man
talk like this before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to trust me to prove all those
things,&#8221; he was running on. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to
trust me, because I&#8217;ve learned a lot this summer.
I&#8217;ve learned a lot about you that you
don&#8217;t know yourself yet. So what I want you
to do is just to take my hand and follow. Can
you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment it seemed that she could.
On the voyage home she had sat much on the
deck alone and looked at the stars, and there
had been many moments when she felt exactly
as she felt now. Thinking of him and looking
at the stars, nothing else had seemed to matter
but just the two of them.</p>
<p>There had been a child on board who had
taken a great fancy to her&ndash;&ndash;a child about the
age of one that was now running about the grass
under the watchful eyes of a nurse. His name
was Peter, and she and Peter used to play tag
together. One afternoon when he was very tired
he had crept into her arms, and she had carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
him to her steamer-chair and wrapped him in
her steamer-rug and held him while he slept.
Then she had felt exactly as when she looked at
the stars. All the things that ordinarily counted
with her did not at that moment count at all.
She had kissed the little head lying on her
bosom and had thought of Don&ndash;&ndash;her heart
pounding as it pounded now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;it&#8217;s only people
in stories who do that way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way we can do&ndash;&ndash;if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Dad,&#8221; she reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He let you become engaged, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t know him as well
as I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put it up to him to-day, if you&#8217;ll let me.
Honest, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as much his affair as
ours, but I&#8217;ll give him a chance. Shall I?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached for his hand and pressed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give him a chance, but I can&#8217;t wait. We
haven&#8217;t time to bother with a wedding&ndash;&ndash;do
you mind that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if he doesn&#8217;t object&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s to-morrow
or next day?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you take away my breath,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if he does object?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s think of that&ndash;&ndash;now,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s walk a little&ndash;&ndash;in the park. It&#8217;s wonderful
out here, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it was wonderful out there&ndash;&ndash;how wonderful
he knew better than she. She had not
had his advantages. She had not had Sally
Winthrop to point out the wonders and make a
man feel them. Of course, it was not the place
itself&ndash;&ndash;not the little paths, the trees, or even
the big, bright sky that Frances meant or he
meant. It was the sense of individuality one
got here: the feeling of something within bigger
than anything without. It was this that permitted
Sally Winthrop to walk here with her
head as high as if she were a princess. It was
this that made him, by her side, feel almost like
a prince. And now Frances was beginning to
sense it. Don felt his heart quicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all you need,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Just
to walk out here a little.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>ONE STUYVESANT</h3>
</div>
<p>That evening, before Frances left Don alone in
the study, she bent over him and kissed him.
Then she heard her father&#8217;s footsteps and ran.
Don was remarkably cool. So was Stuyvesant;
but there was nothing remarkable about that.
When his daughter told him that Don was waiting
to see him, his eyes narrowed the least bit
and he glanced at his watch. He had a bridge
engagement at the club in half an hour. Then
he placed both hands on his daughter&#8217;s shoulders
and studied her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, girlie?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, Dad,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Only&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;And that is what I
want you to be every minute of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Entering his study, Stuyvesant sat down
in a big chair to the right of the open fire
and waved his hand to another opposite
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Frances said you wished to talk over something
with me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Don. He did not sit
down. He could think better on his feet. &#8220;It&#8217;s
about our marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuyvesant did not answer. He never answered
until the other man was through. Then
he knew where he stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether or not you know the
sort of will father left,&#8221; began Don.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant did know, but he gave no indication
of the fact. He had been waiting a year for
something of this sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; Don went on, &#8220;he took a notion
to tie up most of the estate. Except for the
house&ndash;&ndash;well, he left me pretty nearly strapped.
Before that, he&#8217;d been letting me draw on him
for anything I wanted. When I asked you for
Frances I expected things would go on as they
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the change came, I had a talk with
Frances, and we agreed that the thing to do was
for me to go out and earn about the same sum
Dad had been handing to me. Ten thousand
a year seemed at the time what we needed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
She said that was what her allowance had
been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Don paused, in the hope that Stuyvesant
might wish to contribute something to the
conversation. But Stuyvesant waited for him
to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I went out to earn it. Barton found a
position for me with Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves,
and I started in. It&#8217;s a fact I expected to get
that ten thousand inside of a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don lighted a cigarette. The further he
went, the less interest he was taking in this explanation.
Stuyvesant&#8217;s apparent indifference
irritated him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a year ago,&#8221; Don resumed. &#8220;To-day
I&#8217;m drawing the same salary I started
with&ndash;&ndash;twelve hundred. I expect a raise soon&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
to twenty-five hundred. But the
point is this: I figure that it&#8217;s going to take me
some five years to get that ten thousand. I
don&#8217;t want to wait that long before marrying
Frances. Another point is this: I don&#8217;t think
any longer that it&#8217;s necessary. I figure that we
can live on what I&#8217;m earning now. So I&#8217;ve put
it up to her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>Don had hurried his argument a little, but,
as far as he was concerned, he was through.
The whole situation was distasteful to him.
The longer he stayed here, the less it seemed to
be any of Stuyvesant&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ve asked my daughter to
marry you on that salary?&#8221; inquired Stuyvesant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her this afternoon,&#8221; nodded Don.
&#8220;I suggested that we get married to-morrow
or next day. You see, I&#8217;m on my vacation, and
I have only two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuyvesant flicked the ashes from his cigar.
&#8220;What was her reply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wanted me to put the proposition
before you. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. And just what do you expect of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she wants your consent,&#8221; answered
Don. &#8220;Anyhow, it seemed only decent
to let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuyvesant was beginning to chew the end of
his cigar&ndash;&ndash;a bit of nervousness he had not been
guilty of for twenty years. &#8220;At least, it would
have been rather indecent not to have informed
me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But, of course, you don&#8217;t
expect my consent to such an act of idiocy.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>It was Don&#8217;s turn to remain silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no objection to you personally,&#8221; Stuyvesant
began. &#8220;When you came to me and
asked for my daughter&#8217;s hand, and I found that
she wanted to marry you, I gave my consent.
I knew your blood, Pendleton, and I&#8217;d seen
enough of you to believe you clean and straight.
At that time also I had every reason to believe
that you were to have a sufficient income
to support the girl properly. If she had
wanted to marry you within the next month, I
wouldn&#8217;t have said a word at that time. When
I learned that conditions had been changed by
the terms of your father&#8217;s will, I waited to see
what you would do. And I&#8217;ll tell you frankly, I
like the way you&#8217;ve handled the situation up to
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get that last,&#8221; Don answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me help you,&#8221; Stuyvesant resumed
grimly. &#8220;In the first place, get that love-in-a-cottage
idea out of your head. It&#8217;s a pretty
enough conceit for those who are forced to make
the best of their personal misfortunes, but that
is as far as it goes. Don&#8217;t for a moment think
it&#8217;s a desirable lot.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In a way, that&#8217;s just what I <i>am</i> thinking,&#8221;
answered Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t know any better.
It&#8217;s nonsense. A woman wants money
and wants the things she can buy with money.
She&#8217;s entitled to those things. If she can&#8217;t have
them, then it&#8217;s her misfortune. If the man she
looks to to supply them can&#8217;t give them to her,
then it&#8217;s his misfortune. But it&#8217;s nothing for
him to boast about. If he places her in such a
situation deliberately, it&#8217;s something for him to
be ashamed of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that, sir,&#8221; answered Don, &#8220;when
it&#8217;s carried too far. But you understand that
I&#8217;m provided with a good home and a salary
large enough for the ordinary decent things of
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the point,&#8221; broke in Stuyvesant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll admit the girl won&#8217;t have to go hungry,
but she&#8217;ll go without a lot of other things that
she&#8217;s been brought up to have, and, as long as I
can supply them, things she&#8217;s entitled to have.
On that salary you won&#8217;t supply her with many
cars, you won&#8217;t supply her with the kind of
clothes she is accustomed to, you won&#8217;t supply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
her with all the money she wants to spend.
What if she does throw it away? That&#8217;s her
privilege now. I&#8217;ve worked twenty-five years
to get enough so that she can do just that.
There&#8217;s not a whim in the world she can&#8217;t satisfy.
And the man who marries her must give
her every single thing I&#8217;m able to give her&ndash;&ndash;and
then something more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In money?&#8221; asked Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;The something more&ndash;&ndash;not in money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and stood before Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been frank with you, Pendleton, and
I&#8217;ll say I think the girl cares for you. But I
know Frances better than you, and I know that,
even if she made up her mind to do without all
these things, it would mean a sacrifice. As far
as I know, she&#8217;s never had to make a sacrifice
since she was born. It isn&#8217;t necessary. Get
that point, Pendleton. It isn&#8217;t necessary, and
I&#8217;ll not allow any man to make it necessary if I
can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as if expecting an outburst from
Don. The latter remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve trusted you with the girl,&#8221; Stuyvesant
concluded. &#8220;Up to now I&#8217;ve no fault to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
with you. You&#8217;ve lost your head for a minute,
but you&#8217;ll get a grip on yourself. Go ahead and
make your fortune, and come to me again. In
the mean while, I&#8217;m willing to trust you
further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that means not asking Frances to marry
me to-morrow, you can&#8217;t, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you wouldn&#8217;t ask her to go against
my wishes in the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you expect her to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she won&#8217;t,&#8221; Stuyvesant answered.
He was chewing his cigar again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke of the something more, sir,&#8221; said
Don. &#8220;I think I know what that means, and
it&#8217;s a whole lot more than anything your ten
thousand can give. When I found myself stony
broke, I was dazed for a while, and thought a
good deal as you think. Then this summer I
found the something more. I wouldn&#8217;t swap
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then stay where you are,&#8221; snapped Stuyvesant.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to drag in Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don prepared to leave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you aren&#8217;t stony broke too,&#8221; he
observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; answered Stuyvesant. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
not, and I don&#8217;t intend to have my daughter
put in that position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten that I have a house
and twelve hundred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten that is all you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten the something
more?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuyvesant looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be excused now, Pendleton,&#8221; he
concluded. &#8220;I think, on the whole, it will be
better if you don&#8217;t call here after this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; answered Pendleton. &#8220;But
I hope you&#8217;ll come and see us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you, Pendleton!&#8221; he exploded.</p>
<p>Then he turned quickly and left the room.
So, after all, it was he in the end who lost his
temper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE STARS AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Don went to the nearest telephone and rang
up Frances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father lost his temper,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;He ordered me not to call again; so will you
please to meet me on the corner right away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just seen him,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Oh,
Don, it was awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the best thing that could have happened,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We have to meet in the park
now. It&#8217;s the only place left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, dear, he told me not to meet you
anywhere again. He&ndash;&ndash;he was quite savage
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had no right to tell you that,&#8221; Don
answered. &#8220;Anyhow, I must see you. We&#8217;ll
talk it over under the stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Don&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please to hurry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She slipped a scarf over her hair and a cape
over her shoulders, and walked to the corner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
looking about fearfully. He gripped her arm
and led her confidently away from the house
and toward the park. The sky was clear, and
just beyond the Big Dipper he saw shining
steadily the star he had given Sally Winthrop.
He smiled. It was as if she reassured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say to him, Don?&#8221; she
panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I wished to marry you to-morrow,&#8221;
he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I shouldn&#8217;t. He said he could give
you more with his ten thousand than I could
give you with my twelve hundred. I told him
I could give you more with my twelve hundred
than he could with his ten thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen him so angry,&#8221; she trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never before seen him angry at all,&#8221; he
admitted. &#8220;But, after all, that isn&#8217;t important,
is it? The important thing is whether or
not he&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what you and I must
decide for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not quite understand. She thought
her father had already decided this question.
However, she said nothing. In something of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
daze, she allowed herself to be led on toward the
park&ndash;&ndash;at night a big, shadowy region with a
star-pricked sky overhead. Like one led in a
dream she went, her thoughts quite confused,
but with the firm grip of his hand upon her arm
steadying her. He did not speak again until the
paved street and the stone buildings were behind
them&ndash;&ndash;until they were among the trees
and low bushes and gravel paths. He led her to
a bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;See those stars?&#8221; he asked, pointing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to keep looking at them while
I&#8217;m talking to you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Just beyond the Big Dipper he saw the star
he had given Sally Winthrop. It smiled reassuringly
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve learned this summer,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;is that, after all, the clear sky and those stars
are as much a part of New York as the streets
and high buildings below them. And when you
live up there a little while you forget about the
twelve hundred or the ten thousand. Those
details don&#8217;t count up there. Do you see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with your father, and the
trouble with you, and the trouble with me, until
a little while ago, is that we didn&#8217;t get out here
in the park enough where the stars can be seen.
I&#8217;m pretty sure, if I&#8217;d been sitting here with
your father, he&#8217;d have felt different.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was doing as he bade her and keeping her
eyes raised. She saw the steady stars and the
twinkling stars and the vast purple depths. So,
when she felt his arm about her, that did not
seem strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up there we&#8217;ll be living most of the
time,&#8221; he was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all free. The poorer you are, the
freer it is. That&#8217;s true of a lot of things.
You&#8217;ve no idea the things you can get here in
New York if you haven&#8217;t too much money.
Your father said that if you don&#8217;t have cash
you go without, when as a matter of fact it&#8217;s
when you have cash you go without.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes to his. What he was
saying sounded topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; he ran on. &#8220;Why, you can get
hungry if you don&#8217;t have too much money; and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
honest, I&#8217;ve had better things to eat this summer,
because of that, than I ever had in my
life. Then, if you don&#8217;t have too much money,
you can work. It sounds strange to say there&#8217;s
any fun in that, but there is. I want to get
you into the game, Frances. You&#8217;re going to
like it. Farnsworth is going to let me sell next
month. It&#8217;s like making the &#8217;Varsity. I&#8217;m going
to have a salary and commission, so you
see it will be partly a personal fight. You
can help me. Why, the very things we were
planning to get done with before we married are
the very things that are worth while. We can
stand shoulder to shoulder now and play the
game together. You can have part of the fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thrilled with the magic of his voice, but
his words were quite meaningless.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t looking at the stars,&#8221; he reminded
her. She looked up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no sense in waiting
any longer, is there? The sooner we&#8217;re married,
the sooner we can begin. If we&#8217;re married to-morrow,
we&#8217;ll have almost two weeks in the
mountains. And then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She appeared frightened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don, we&ndash;&ndash;we couldn&#8217;t get married
like that, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it isn&#8217;t possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly it&#8217;s possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t. Oh, Don, you&#8217;ll
have to give me time to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t time,&#8221; he frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must take time. I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of myself,&#8221; she answered quickly.
&#8220;Afraid of Dad. Oh, I&#8217;m afraid of every
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of me?&#8221; He took her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you speak of to-morrow I am,&#8221; she
admitted. &#8220;While you were talking, there were
moments when&ndash;&ndash;when I could do as you wish.
But they didn&#8217;t last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you didn&#8217;t keep your eyes
on the stars,&#8221; he assured her gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m afraid of&ndash;&ndash;that I shouldn&#8217;t
be able to keep them there. Don, dear, you
don&#8217;t know how selfish I am and&ndash;&ndash;and how
many things I want.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>She was seeing herself clearly now and
speaking from the depths of her soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it isn&#8217;t all my fault. And you&#8217;re
wonderful, Don. It&#8217;s that which makes me see
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed her hand. &#8220;Dear you,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;I know the woman &#8217;way down deep in
you, and it&#8217;s she I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s some woman
you&#8217;ve placed there&ndash;&ndash;some woman who might
have been there&ndash;&ndash;that you see. But she isn&#8217;t
there, because&ndash;&ndash;because I can&#8217;t go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some woman he had put there. He looked
at the stars, and the little star by the Big
Dipper was shining steadily at him. He passed
his hand over his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she were really in me, she&#8217;d go with you
to-morrow,&#8221; Frances ran on excitedly. &#8220;She&#8217;d
want to get into the game. She&#8217;d want to be
hungry with you, and she wouldn&#8217;t care about
anything else in the world but you. She&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;d
want to suffer, Don. She&#8217;d be almost
glad that you had no money. Her father
wouldn&#8217;t count, because she&#8217;d care so much.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>She drew her cape about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered in a hoarse whisper;
&#8220;she&#8217;s like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, don&#8217;t you see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, I do see!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Now he saw.</p>
<p>With his head swimming, with his breath
coming short, he saw. But he was as dazed as
a man suddenly given sight in the glare of the
blazing sun.</p>
<p>Frances was frightened by his silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I think we&#8217;d better go back now,&#8221; she
said gently.</p>
<p>He escorted her to the house without quite
knowing how he found the way. At the door
she said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll not think too badly of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything you can help,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything I can help, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think too badly of Dad,&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll cool down soon, and then&ndash;&ndash;you must
come and see me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand, and he took it. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
swiftly she turned and went into the house.
He hurried back to the path&ndash;&ndash;to the path
where on Saturday afternoons he had walked
with Sally Winthrop.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXVIII_SEEING' id='CHAPTER_XXVIII_SEEING'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>SEEING</h3>
</div>
<p>He saw now. Blind fool that he had been,
month after month! He sank on a bench and
went back in his thoughts to the first time he
had ever seen Sally Winthrop. She had reminded
him that it was luncheon time, and
when he had gone out she had been waiting for
him. She must have been waiting for him, or
he never would have found her. And she had
known he was hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d want to be hungry with you,&#8221;
Frances had said.</p>
<p>How had Sally Winthrop known that he
was hungry? She had known, and had shared
with him what she had.</p>
<p>Then incident after incident in the office
came back to him. It was she who had taught
him how to work. It was for her that he had
worked.</p>
<p>Frances had used another phrase: &#8220;She&#8217;d
be almost glad you had no money.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>There was only one woman in the world he
knew who would care for a man like that&ndash;&ndash;if
she cared at all. That brought him to his feet
again. He glared about as if searching for
her in the dark. Why wasn&#8217;t she here now, so
that he might ask her if she did care? She had
no business to go off and leave him like this!
He did not know where she was.</p>
<p>Don struck a match and looked at his watch.
It was eight-thirty. Somehow, he must find
her. He had her old address, and it was possible
that she had left word where she had gone.
At any rate, this was the only clue he had.</p>
<p>He made his way back to the Avenue, and,
at a pace that at times almost broke into a run,
went toward the club and the first taxi he saw.
In twenty minutes he was standing on the
steps where he had last seen her. She had
wished him to say &#8220;good-bye&#8221;; but he remembered
that he had refused to say &#8220;good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>The landlady knew Miss Winthrop&#8217;s address,
but she was not inclined to give it to him. At
first she did not like the expression in his eyes.
He was too eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; she argued, &#8220;she&#8217;d have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
told parties where she was going if she wanted
them to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very important,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a lot more important to you
than it is to her,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can leave your name and address, and
I&#8217;ll write to her,&#8221; she offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; Don said desperately. &#8220;Do
you want to know what my business is with
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my business, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to ask her to marry me,&#8221; he broke
in. &#8220;That&#8217;s a respectable business, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached in his pocket and drew out a bill.
He slipped it into her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to marry her?&#8221; exclaimed the woman.
&#8220;Well, now, I wouldn&#8217;t stand in the way of
that. Will you step in while I get the address?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait here. Only hurry. There may be
a late train.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was back in a few seconds, holding a slip
of paper in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to Brenton, Maine, she&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>Don grabbed the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was halfway down the steps when she
called after him:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck to ye, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks again,&#8221; he called back.</p>
<p>Then he gave his order to the driver:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Grand Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don found that he could take the midnight
train to Boston and connect there with a ten-o&#8217;clock
train next morning. This would get
him into Portland in time for a connection that
would land him at Brenton at four that afternoon.
He went back to the house to pack his
bag. As he opened the door and went in, it
seemed as if she might already be there&ndash;&ndash;as
if she might be waiting for him. Had she
stepped forward to greet him and announce
that dinner was ready, he would not have been
greatly surprised. It was as if she had been
here all this last year. But it was only Nora
who came to greet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away to-night for a few days&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
for two weeks,&#8221; he told Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wire you what my plans are&ndash;&ndash;either
to-morrow or next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is to be soon, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you for sure, Nora, until I&#8217;ve
cleared up one or two little matters; but&ndash;&ndash;you
can wish me luck, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the house is ready, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is ready, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Now I&#8217;m going to pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>His packing finished, Don went downstairs
with still an hour or more on his hands before
train-time. But he did not care to go anywhere.
He was absolutely contented here. He
was content merely to wander from room to
room. He sat down at the piano in the dark,
and for a long while played to her&ndash;&ndash;played
to her just the things he knew she would
like.</p>
<p>It was half-past eleven before he left the
house, and then he went almost reluctantly.
She was more here than anywhere in the world
except where he was going. He found himself
quite calm about her here. The moment he
came out on the street again he noticed a difference.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
His own phrase came back to frighten
him:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d care like that&ndash;&ndash;if she cared at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supposing that after he found her, she did
not care?</p>
<p>At the station he wondered if it were best to
wire her, but decided against it. She might
run away. It was never possible to tell what a
woman might do, and Sally Winthrop was an
adept at concealing herself. He remembered
that period when, although he had been in the
same office with her, she had kept herself as
distant as if across the ocean. She had only to
say, &#8220;Not at home,&#8221; and it was as if she said,
&#8220;I am not anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to his berth at once, and had, on
the whole, a bad night of it. He asked himself
a hundred questions that he could not answer&ndash;&ndash;that
Sally Winthrop alone could answer.
Though it was only lately that he had
prided himself on knowing her desires in everything,
he was forced to leave all these questions
unanswered.</p>
<p>At ten the next morning he took the train
for Portland. At two he was on the train for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
Brenton and hurrying through a strange country
to her side.</p>
<p>When he reached Brenton he was disappointed
not to find her when he stepped from
the train. The station had been so closely
identified with her through the long journey
that he had lost sight of the fact that it existed
for any other purpose. But only a few station
loafers were there to greet him, and they revealed
but an indifferent interest. He approached
one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where Miss Winthrop is
stopping?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked blank.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one of that name in this town,&#8221; he
finally answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this Brenton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Brenton, right enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;s here,&#8221; declared Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she visitin&#8217;?&#8221; inquired the man.</p>
<p>Don nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cousin, or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second man spoke up:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t she the one who&#8217;s stopping with Mrs.
Halliday?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Rather slight, with brown eyes,&#8221; volunteered
Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno the color of her eyes,&#8221; answered the
first man, with a wink at the second. &#8220;But
thar&#8217;s some one stoppin&#8217; thar. Been here couple
days or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s she,&#8221; Don decided.</p>
<p>He drew a dollar bill from his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want one of you to take a note to her from
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wrote on the back of a card:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at the station. I must see you at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>DON</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Take that to her right away and bring me
an answer,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>The man took both bill and card and disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>MOSTLY SALLY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was an extremely frightened girl who within
five minutes appeared upon the station platform.
She was quite out of breath, for she had
been running. As he came toward her with
outstretched hands, she stared at him from
head to foot, as if to make sure he was not
minus an arm or a leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you even shake hands with me?&#8221; he
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you gave me such a fright,&#8221; she
panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought&ndash;&ndash;I thought you must have
been run over.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed rather pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you cared?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>She was fast recovering herself now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it wouldn&#8217;t be unnatural to care,
would it, if you expected to find a friend all
run over?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And, now that you find I&#8217;m not a mangled
corpse, you don&#8217;t care at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course he wouldn&#8217;t choose to be a corpse,
because he would not have been able to enjoy
the situation; but, on the whole, he was sorry
that he did not have a mangled hand or something
to show. Evidently his whole hand did
not interest her&ndash;&ndash;she had not yet offered to
take it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world did you get here?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;has anything happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of things have happened,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to tell you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around. His messenger was taking
an eager interest in the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I came to see you,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Of course, if it&#8217;s necessary to confide
also in your neighbor over there, I&#8217;ll do it;
but I thought that perhaps you could suggest
some less public place.&#8221;</p>
<p>She appeared frightened in a different sort
of way now.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Pendleton&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to remain here perhaps a day or
two,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>
<p>To him the most obvious course was for her
to ask him to meet her aunt and invite him
to remain there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a hotel in town?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he decided, &#8220;I must find some sort
of camping-place. If you know a bit of woods
where I can spend the night, you might direct
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was quite himself now. It was a relief
to her. It put her quite off her guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come and meet my aunt?&#8221; she
invited.</p>
<p>He picked up his suitcase at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a pleasure,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She could not imagine what her aunt would
think when she appeared so abruptly escorting
a young man with a suitcase, but that did not
seem to matter. She knew no better than her
aunt what had brought him here; but, now
that he was here, it was certain that she must
take care of him. She could not allow him to
wander homelessly around the village or permit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
him to camp out like a gypsy. It did not
occur to her to reason that this predicament
was wholly his fault. All the old feeling of
responsibility came back.</p>
<p>As they walked side by side down the street,
he was amazed to see how much good even
these two days in the country had done her.
There was more color in her cheeks and more
life in her walk. She was wearing a middy
blouse, and that made her look five years
younger.</p>
<p>She looked up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I thought you had something very
important to do in these next few days,&#8221; she
reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t understand how you came
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the train it had seemed to him that he
must explain within the first five minutes; but,
now that she was actually within sound of his
voice, actually within reach, there seemed to
be no hurry. In her presence his confidence
increased with every passing minute. For one
thing, he could argue with her, and whenever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
in the past he had argued with her he had succeeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I needed you to explain certain things to
me,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>She looked away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;About getting me married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He could not tell what she meant by the
little cry. He would have asked her had they
not at that moment turned into a gate that led
through an old-fashioned garden to a small
white cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to run ahead and prepare Mrs.
Halliday,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So she left him upon the doorstep, and he
took off his hat to the cool, pine-laden breeze
that came from a mountain in the distance.
He liked this town at once. He liked the elm-lined
village street, and the snug white houses
and the quiet and content of it. Then he found
himself being introduced rather jerkily to Mrs.
Halliday&ndash;&ndash;a tall, thin New England type,
with kindly eyes set in a sharp face. It was
evident at once that after her first keen inspection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
of this stranger she was willing to accept
him with much less suspicion than Miss Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Sally this morning, when I spilled
the sugar, that a stranger was coming,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Now you come right upstairs. I
reckon you&#8217;ll want to wash up after that long
ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty good of you to take me in this
way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laws sake, what&#8217;s a spare room for?&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way to a small room with white
curtains at the windows and rag rugs upon the
floor and a big silk crazy-quilt on an old four-poster
bed. She hurried about and found soap
and towels for him, and left him with the hope
that he would make himself at home.</p>
<p>And at once he did feel at home. He felt at
home just because Sally Winthrop was somewhere
in the same house. That was the secret
of it. He had felt at home in the station as soon
as she appeared; he had felt at home in the village
because she had walked by his side; and
now he felt at home here. And by that he
meant that he felt very free and very happy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
very much a part of any section of the world
she might happen to be in. It had been so in
New York, and it was so here.</p>
<p>He was downstairs again in five minutes,
looking for Sally Winthrop. It seemed that
Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s chief concern now was about
supper, and that Sally was out in the kitchen
helping her. He found that out by walking in
upon her and finding her in a blue gingham
apron. Her cheeks turned very red and she
hurriedly removed the apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me disturb you,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>That was very easy to say, but he did disturb
her. Then Mrs. Halliday shooed her out
of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You run right along now; I can attend to
things myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to help, too,&#8221; said Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along&ndash;&ndash;both of you,&#8221; insisted Mrs.
Halliday. &#8220;You&#8217;d be more bother than
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two found themselves on the front
steps again, and Don suggested they remain
there. The sun was getting low and bathing
the street in a soft light.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have something very important to say
to you,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Again there was the expression of astonishment
and&ndash;&ndash;something more.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about my getting married,&#8221; he
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought that was all settled!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was settled long before I knew
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re to be married right away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be wonderful,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It
will be the most wonderful thing in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why did you come &#8217;way down
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To talk it over with you. You see, a lot
depends upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again that questioning personal pronoun.</p>
<p>&#8220;A great deal depends upon you. You are
to say when it is to be.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Pendleton!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d remember I&#8217;m not in the
office of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves now. Can&#8217;t
you call me just Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I mean to call
you Sally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to call you that all the rest of my
life,&#8221; he went on more soberly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
understand how much depends upon you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Startled, she glanced up swiftly. What she
saw in his eyes made her catch her breath. He
was speaking rapidly now:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything depends upon you&ndash;&ndash;upon no
one else in all the world but you. I discovered
that in less than a day after you left. It&#8217;s
been like that ever since I met you. I love you,
and I&#8217;ve come down here to marry you&ndash;&ndash;to
take you back with me to the house that&#8217;s all
ready&ndash;&ndash;back to the house you&#8217;ve made
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a little cry and covered her face
with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>She looked as if she were crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally&ndash;&ndash;Sally Winthrop, you aren&#8217;t crying?&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed a hand upon her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I touch you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&ndash;&ndash;because this is all a horrible
mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to correct a horrible mistake,&#8221;
he answered gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no. You must go back to her&ndash;&ndash;right
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Frances?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand. She doesn&#8217;t want
to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You asked her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&ndash;&ndash;and then you came to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, little girl. She sent me to you. She&ndash;&ndash;why,
it was she that made me see straight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was still concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I wish you&#8217;d go away,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand!&#8221; he answered
fiercely. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going away. I love you, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
I&#8217;ve come to get you. I won&#8217;t go away until
you come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, her back toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Then she ran into the house, leaving him
standing there dazed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>DON EXPLAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>It seemed that, in spite of her business training
and the unsentimental outlook on life upon
which she had rather prided herself, Sally Winthrop
did not differ greatly from other women.
Shut up in her room, a deep sense of humiliation
overwhelmed her. He had asked this other
girl to marry him, and when she refused he had
come to her! He thought as lightly of her as
that&ndash;&ndash;a mere second choice when the first was
made impossible. He had no justification for
that. This other had sent him to her&ndash;&ndash;doubtless
with a smile of scorn upon her pretty
lips.</p>
<p>But what was she crying about and making
her nose all red? She should have answered
him with another smile and sent him back again.
Then he would have understood how little she
cared&ndash;&ndash;would have understood that she did
not care enough even to feel the sting of such
an insult as this. For the two days she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
been here awaiting the announcement of his
marriage she had said over and over again that
she did not care&ndash;&ndash;said it the first thing upon
waking and the last thing upon retiring. Even
when she woke up in the night, as she did many
times, she said it to herself. It had been a
great comfort to her, for it was a full and complete
answer to any wayward thoughts that
took her unaware.</p>
<p>She did not care about him, so what was she
sniveling about and making her nose all red?
She dabbed her handkerchief into her eyes and
sought her powder-box. If he had only kept
away from her everything would have been
all right. Within the next ten or eleven days
she would have readjusted herself and been
ready to take up her work again, with another
lesson learned. She would have gone back to
her room wiser and with still more confidence
in herself. And now he was downstairs, waiting
for her. There was no way she could escape
him. She must do all those things without the
help of seclusion. She must not care, with him
right before her eyes.</p>
<p>She began to cry again. It was not fair. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
was the sense of injustice that now broke her
down. She was doing her best, and no one
would help her. Even he made it as hard for
her as possible. On top of that he had added
this new insult. He wished a wife, and if he
could not have this one he would take that
one&ndash;&ndash;as Farnsworth selected his stenographers.
He had come to her because she had
allowed herself to lunch with him and dine with
him and walk with him. He had presumed
upon what she had allowed herself to say to
him. Because she had interested herself in
him and tried to help him, he thought she was
to be as lightly considered as this. He had not
waited even a decent interval, but had come
to her direct from Frances&ndash;&ndash;she of the scornful
smile.</p>
<p>Once again Sally stopped crying. If only
she could hold that smile before her, all might
yet be well. Whenever she looked into his eyes
and thought them tender, she must remember
that smile. Whenever his voice tempted her
against her reason, she must remember that&ndash;&ndash;for
to-night, anyhow; and to-morrow he must
go back. Either that or she would leave. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
could not endure this very long&ndash;&ndash;certainly
not for eleven days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally&ndash;&ndash;where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s voice from downstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The supper was more of an epicurean than
a social success. Mrs. Halliday had made hot
biscuit, and opened a jar of strawberry preserves,
and sliced a cold chicken which she had
originally intended for to-morrow&#8217;s dinner; but,
in spite of that, she was forced to sit by and
watch her two guests do scarcely more than
nibble.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, I don&#8217;t think young folks eat as
much as they useter in my days,&#8221; she commented.</p>
<p>Don tried to excuse himself by referring to a
late dinner at Portland; but Sally, as usual,
had no excuse whatever. She was forced to
endure in silence the searching inquiry of Mrs.
Halliday&#8217;s eyes as well as Don&#8217;s. For the half-hour
they were at table she heartily wished she
was back again in her own room in New York.
There, at least, she would have been free to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
shut herself up, away from all eyes but her
own. Moreover, she had to look forward to
what she should do at the end of the meal. For
all she saw, she was going to be then in even a
worse plight than she was now. For he would
be able to talk, and she must needs answer and
keep from crying. Above all things else, she
must keep from crying. She did not wish him
to think her a little fool as well as other things.</p>
<p>She was forced to confess that after the first
five minutes Don did his best to relieve the
tension. He talked to Mrs. Halliday about one
thing and another, and kept on talking. And,
though it was quite evident to her that he had
no appetite, he managed to consume three of
the hot biscuit. After supper, when she rose
to help her aunt in the kitchen, he wished
also to help. But Mrs. Halliday would have
neither of them. That made it bad for her
again, for it left her with no alternative but to
sit again upon the front porch with him. So
there they were again, right back where they
started.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you run into the house for?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Please let&#8217;s not talk any more, of that,&#8221; she
pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the nub of the whole matter,&#8221; he
insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went in because I did not want to talk
any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Then you needn&#8217;t talk. But
you can listen, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exactly the opposite thing. You can
listen, and just nod or shake your head. Then
you won&#8217;t have to speak a word. Will you do
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an absurd proposition, but she was
forced either to accept it or to run away again.
Somehow, it did not appear especially dignified
to keep on running away, when in the end
she must needs come back again. So she
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the beginning,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;That&#8217;s somewhere toward the middle
of my senior year. I&#8217;d known Frances before
that, but about that time she came on to
Boston, and we went to a whole lot of dances
and things together.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>He paused a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d brought a picture of her with
me,&#8221; he resumed thoughtfully, &#8220;because she&#8217;s
really a peach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop looked up quickly. He was
apparently serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s tall and dark and slender,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;and when she&#8217;s all togged up she certainly
looks like a queen. She had a lot of friends in
town, and we kept going about four nights a
week. Then came the ball games, and then
Class Day. You ever been to Class Day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop shook her head with a quick
little jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all music and Japanese lanterns, and
if you&#8217;re sure of your degree it&#8217;s a sort of fairyland
where nothing is quite real. You just
feel at the time that it&#8217;s always going to be
like that. It was then I asked her to marry
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Winthrop was sitting with her chin in
her hands, looking intently at the brick path
leading to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You listening?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded jerkily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It seemed all right then. And it seemed all
right after that. Stuyvesant was agreeable
enough, and so I came on to New York. Then
followed Dad&#8217;s death. Dad was a queer sort,
but he was square as a die. I&#8217;m sorry he went
before he had a chance to meet you. I didn&#8217;t
realize what good pals we were until afterward.
But, anyway, he died, and he tied the property
all up as I&#8217;ve told you. Maybe he thought
if he didn&#8217;t I&#8217;d blow it in, because I see now
I&#8217;d been getting rid of a good many dollars. I
went to Frances and told her all about it, and
offered to cancel the engagement. But she was
a good sport and said she&#8217;d wait until I earned
ten thousand a year. You listening?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s right here you come in. I
was going to get it inside a year, and you know
just about how much chance I stood. But it
looked easy to her, because her father was pulling
down about that much a month, and not
killing himself either. I didn&#8217;t know any more
about it than she did; but the difference between
us was that as soon as I was on the inside
I learned a lot she didn&#8217;t learn. I learned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
how hard it is to get ten thousand a year; more
than that, I learned how unnecessary it is to get
it. That&#8217;s what you taught me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>
<p>She closed her lips firmly together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you meant to or not isn&#8217;t the
point. You did teach me that and a lot of
other things. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, and
went plugging ahead, thinking everything was
just the same when it wasn&#8217;t at all. Frances
was headed one way and I was headed another.
Then she went abroad, and after that I learned
faster than ever. I learned what a home can
be made to mean, and work can be made to
mean, and life can be made to mean. All those
things you were teaching me. I didn&#8217;t know it,
and you didn&#8217;t know it, and Frances didn&#8217;t
know it. That ten thousand grew less and less
important to me, and all the while I thought
it must be growing less and less important to
her. I thought that way after the walks in the
park and the walks in the country and that
night at Coney.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I thought it even after she came back&ndash;&ndash;even
after my talk with Stuyvesant. He told
me I was a fool and that Frances wouldn&#8217;t listen
to me. I didn&#8217;t believe him and put it up
to her. And then&ndash;&ndash;for the first time&ndash;&ndash;I saw
that what I had been learning she had not been
learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don turned and looked at the girl by his side.
It was growing dark now, so that he could not
see her very well; but he saw that she was huddled
up as he had found her that day in the
little restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frances didn&#8217;t have the nerve to come
with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Her father stood in the
way, and she couldn&#8217;t get by him. I want to
be fair about this. At the beginning, if she&#8217;d
come with me I&#8217;d have married her&ndash;&ndash;though
Lord knows how it would have worked out.
But she didn&#8217;t dare&ndash;&ndash;and she&#8217;s a pretty good
sport, too. There&#8217;s a lot in her she doesn&#8217;t
know anything about. It would do her good to
know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he paused. It was as if he were trying
hard to keep his balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her to know you,&#8221; he went on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
&#8220;Because, after all, it was she who made me
see you. There, in a second, in the park, she
pointed you out to me, until you stood before
me as clear as the star by the Big Dipper. She
said, &#8216;It&#8217;s some other girl you&#8217;re seeing in me&ndash;&ndash;a
girl who would dare to go hungry with
you.&#8217; Then I knew. So I came right to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was still huddled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here I am,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>There he was. He did not need to remind
her of that. Even when she closed her eyes so
that she might not see him, she was aware of it.
Even when he was through talking and she did
not hear his voice, she was aware of it. And,
though she was miserable about it, she would
have been more miserable had he been anywhere
else.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, little girl,&#8221; he said patiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even after I told you to go away,&#8221; she
choked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even after you told me to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you only hadn&#8217;t come at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else was there for me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you could have gone to that camp
with her. She wanted you to go.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I told her I couldn&#8217;t go there&ndash;&ndash;long before
I knew why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have gone&ndash;&ndash;oh, there are so
many other places you could go! And this is
the only place I <i>could</i> go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only place I could go, too. Honest,
it was. I&#8217;d have been miserable anywhere else,
and&ndash;&ndash;well, you aren&#8217;t making it very comfortable
for me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed natural to have him blame her for
his discomfort when it was all his own fault. It
seemed so natural, in the midst of the confusion
of all the rest of the tangle, that it was restful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess the only thing for me to do is
to go away myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to New York. Oh, I wish I hadn&#8217;t
taken a vacation!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go back if you say so; but it seems
foolish after traveling all this distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to go back alone,&#8221; she hastened to
correct him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave me with Mrs. Halliday?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t mix things all up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you who are mixing things all up,&#8221;
he said earnestly. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t like you, little
girl. It&#8217;s more like you to straighten things
out. There&#8217;s a straight road ahead of us now,
and if you&#8217;ll only take it we&#8217;ll never leave it
again. All we&#8217;ve got to do is to hunt up a parson
and get married, and then we&#8217;ll go anywhere
you say, or not go anywhere at all. It&#8217;s
as simple as that. Then, when our vacation is
up, I&#8217;ll go back to Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves,
and I&#8217;ll tell Farnsworth he&#8217;ll have to get a new
stenographer. Maybe he&#8217;ll discharge me for
that, but if he doesn&#8217;t I&#8217;ll tell him I want to
get out and sell. And then there&#8217;s nothing
more to it. With you to help&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried to find her hands, but she had them
pressed over her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;With you back home to help,&#8221; he repeated&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
not anything in the world we
won&#8217;t get.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the dream woman in Sally answered
to the woman on the steps:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not anything more in the world
we&#8217;ll want when we&#8217;re home.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>But Don did not hear that. All he heard
was a sigh. To the dream woman what he said
sounded like music; but the woman on the
steps answered cynically:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;All he is saying to you now he said to
that other. There, where the music was playing
and the Japanese lanterns were bobbing,
he said it to her. That was a fairy world,
as this is a fairy night; but back in New York
it will all be different. There are no fairies in
New York. Every time you have thought
there were, you have been disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose swiftly to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we mustn&#8217;t talk about it!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He too rose, and he placed both his hands
upon her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said quickly.
&#8220;What is it you don&#8217;t believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in fairies,&#8221; she answered
bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe that I love you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night&ndash;&ndash;perhaps,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>Her eyes were not meeting his.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe my love will last?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of Frances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is so different in New York,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of Frances?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not sure enough herself to answer
that. She did not wish to be unfair. He removed
his hands from her shoulders and stood
back a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d understand about her. I
thought you were the one woman in the world
who&#8217;d understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s easier for men to understand
those things than women,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so little to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, truly it seemed so. But it was
always that way when she was with him. Always,
if she was not very careful, he made her
see exactly as he saw. It was so at Jacques&#8217;;
it was so at Coney. But her whole life was at
stake now. If she made a mistake, one way or
the other, she must live it out&ndash;&ndash;in New York.
She must be by herself when she reached her
decision.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In the morning,&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>He took her hand&ndash;&ndash;catching her unawares.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Up there is the star I gave
you. It will always be there&ndash;&ndash;always be yours.
And, if you can, I want you to think of me as
like that star.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upstairs in her room that night, Miss Winthrop
sat by her window and tried to place
herself back in New York&ndash;&ndash;back in the office
of Carter, Rand &amp; Seagraves. It was there,
after all, and not up among the stars, that she
had gained her experience of men.</p>
<p>From behind her typewriter she had watched
them come and go, or if they stayed had
watched them in the making. It was from behind
her typewriter she had met Don. She
remembered every detail of that first day: how
he stood at the ticker like a boy with a new
toy, waiting for Farnsworth; how he came from
Farnsworth&#8217;s office and took a seat near her,
and for the next half-hour watched her fingers
until she became nervous. At first she thought
he was going to be &#8220;fresh.&#8221; Her mind was
made up to squelch him at the first opportunity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Yet, when it had come lunch-time and
he sat on, not knowing what to do, she had
taken pity on him. She knew he would sit on
there until night unless some one showed an
interest in him. She was glad now that she
had, because he had been hungry. Had it
not been for her, he would not have had anything
to eat all day&ndash;&ndash;possibly not all that
week. She would never cease being glad that
she had discovered this fact in time.</p>
<p>But she had intended that her interest should
cease, once she had made sure that he was fed
and in receipt of his first week&#8217;s salary. That
much she would do for any man, good, bad, or
indifferent. That was all she had intended.
She could say that honestly. When he had
appeared at her lunch-place the second and
third time, she had resented it. But she had
also welcomed his coming. And, when she
had bidden him not to come, she had missed
him.</p>
<p>Right here she marked a distinction between
him and the others. She missed him outside
the office&ndash;&ndash;not only at noon, but at night.
When she had opened that absurd box of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
flowers, she brought him into her room with
her. She saw now that at the precise moment
she opened that box she had lost her point of
view. If she had wished to maintain it, she
should have promptly done the box up again
and sent it back to him.</p>
<p>After this their relation had changed. There
could be no doubt about that. However, except
for the initial fault of not returning the
roses, she could not see where it was distinctly
her fault. She had gone on day after
day, unaware that any significant change was
taking place. There had been the dinner at
Jacques&#8217;, and then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>With her chin in her hands, she sat by the
open window and lived over again those days.
Her eyes grew afire and her cheeks grew rosy
and a great happiness thrilled her. So&ndash;&ndash;until
they reached that night at Coney and Frances
smiled through the dark at her.</p>
<p>Then she sprang to her feet and paced the
floor, with the color gone from her cheeks.
During all those glorious days this other girl
had been in the background of his thoughts.
It was for her he had been working&ndash;&ndash;of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
he had been thinking. She clenched her hands
and faced the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay home with him,
then?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You left him to me and I
took care of him. He&#8217;d have lost his position
if it hadn&#8217;t been for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept after him until he made good,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;I saw that he came to work on time,
I showed him what to learn. It was I, not you,
that made him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was speaking out loud&ndash;&ndash;fiercely. Suddenly
she stopped. She raised her eyes to the
window&ndash;&ndash;to the little star by the Big Dipper.
Gently, as a mother speaks, she said again:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made him&ndash;&ndash;not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sally Winthrop sank into a chair. She began
to cry&ndash;&ndash;but softly now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mine, Don,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;You&#8217;re
mine because I took care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A keen breeze from the mountains swept in
upon her. She rose and stole across the hall to
Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s room. That good woman
awoke with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry if I woke you,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
the girl. &#8220;But it&#8217;s turned cold, and I wondered
if Don&ndash;&ndash;if Mr. Pendleton had enough bedclothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laws sake,&#8221; answered Mrs. Halliday. &#8220;I
gave him two extra comforters, and if that
ain&#8217;t enough he deserves to freeze.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXI_SALLY_DECIDES' id='CHAPTER_XXXI_SALLY_DECIDES'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>SALLY DECIDES</h3>
</div>
<p>The clarion call of Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s big red
rooster announcing fervently his discovery of
a thin streak of silver light in the east brought
Don to his elbow with a start. For a moment
he could not place himself, and then, as he realized
where he was and what this day meant for
him, he took a long deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning,&#8221; she had said.</p>
<p>Technically it was now morning, though his
watch informed him that it was not yet five.
By now, then, she had made her decision.
Somewhere in this old house, perhaps within
sound of his voice, she was waiting with the
verdict that was to decide whether he was
going back to New York the happiest or the
unhappiest man in all Christendom. No, that
was not quite right either. Even if she said
&#8220;No&#8221; that would not decide it. It would mean
only another day of waiting, because he was
going to keep right on trying to make her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
understand&ndash;&ndash;day after day, all summer and
next winter and the next summer if necessary.
He was going to do that because, if he ever let
go of this hope, then he would be letting go
of everything.</p>
<p>He found it quite impossible to sleep again
and equally impossible to lie there awake.
Jumping from bed he dressed, shaved, and went
downstairs, giving Mrs. Halliday the start of
her life when he came upon her as she was
kindling the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes alive,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
expect to see you for a couple hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s early,&#8221; he answered uncomfortably;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose Sally is up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday touched a match to the kindling
and put the stove covers back in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything lazy about Sally,
but she generally does wait until the sun is up,&#8221;
she returned.</p>
<p>She filled the teakettle and then, adjusting
her glasses, took a more critical look at Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t ye warm enough last night?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty, thank you,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps bein&#8217; in new surroundings bothered
you,&#8221; she suggested; &#8220;I can&#8217;t ever sleep
myself till I git used to a place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I slept like a log,&#8221; he assured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the time ye ginerally git up in New
York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite as early as this,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;But, you see, that rooster&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;And ye kind of hoped
it might wake up Sally too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a chance,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, as long as ye seem so anxious
I&#8217;ll tell ye something; maybe it did. Anyhow,
I heard her movin&#8217; round afore I came down.
Draw a chair up to the stove and make yourself
comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dry heat from the burning wood was
already warming the room. Outside he heard
the morning songs of the birds. It no longer
seemed early to him. It was as though the
world were fully awake, just because he knew
now that Sally was awake. For a few minutes
Mrs. Halliday continued her tasks as though
unmindful that he was about. It was such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
sort of friendly acceptance of him as part of
the household that he began to feel as much
at home here as though it were his usual custom
to appear at this hour. There was something
more friendly about even Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s
back than about the faces of a great
many people he knew. It looked as though it
had borne a great many burdens, but having
borne them sturdily was ready for more. It
invited confidences. Then the teakettle began
to bubble and sing and that invited confidences
too. He was choking with things he
wished to say&ndash;&ndash;preferably to Sally herself,
but if that were not possible, then Mrs. Halliday
was certainly the next best confidante.
Besides, being the closest relative of Sally&#8217;s
it was only fitting and proper that she should
be told certain facts. Sooner or later she must
know and now seemed a particularly opportune
time. Don rose and moved his chair to
attract her attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Halliday&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; she replied, without turning. She
was at that moment busy over the biscuit
board.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I think I ought to tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned instantly at that&ndash;&ndash;turned, adjusted
her spectacles, and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve asked Sally to marry me,&#8221; he
confessed.</p>
<p>For a moment her thin, wrinkled face
remained immobile. Then he saw a smile
brighten the shrewd gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
wonderin&#8217; just how long ye&#8217;d be tellin&#8217; me
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew? Sally told you?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in so many words, as ye might say,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;But laws sake, when a girl
wakes me up to say she doesn&#8217;t think a young
man has blankets enough on his bed in this kind
of weather&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did that?&#8221; interrupted Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s jest what she did. But long afore
thet you told me yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. It&#8217;s jest oozin&#8217; out all over
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came nearer. For a second Don felt as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
though those gray eyes were boring into his
soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, young man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What
did Sally say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she&#8217;d let me know this morning,&#8221;
he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been blamin&#8217; my old rooster
for gettin&#8217; you up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not blaming him exactly,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you aren&#8217;t sure whether she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to say yes or goin&#8217; to say no?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;s lips tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether she&#8217;s going to say
yes or no this morning. But, believe me, Mrs.
Halliday, before she dies she&#8217;s going to say yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday nodded approvingly. She
went further; she placed a thin hand on Don&#8217;s
shoulder. It was like a benediction. His heart
warmed as though it had been his mother&#8217;s
hand there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don,&#8221; she said, as naturally as though she
had been saying it all her life, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
much about you in one way. But I like your
face and I like your eyes. I go a lot by a man&#8217;s
eyes. More&#8217;n that, I know Sally, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
was never a finer, honester girl made than she
is. If she has let you go as far as this, I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;d worry myself to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;She
didn&#8217;t let me go as far as this. I&ndash;&ndash;I just
went.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday smiled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you think so,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>But at that moment he heard a rustle of
skirts behind him. There stood Sally herself&ndash;&ndash;her
cheeks very red, with a bit of a frown
above her eyes. It was Mrs. Halliday who
saved the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, now, you two,&#8221; she stormed as she
went back to her biscuit board. &#8220;Both of you
clear out of here until breakfast is ready. You
belong outdoors where the birds are singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll set the table, Aunty,&#8221; replied Sally
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Halliday.</p>
<p>She crossed the room and, taking Sally by
one arm she took Don by the other. She led
them to the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Out with you,&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>Alone with her Don turned to seek Sally&#8217;s
eyes and saw the frown still there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I told her,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
help it. I&#8217;ve been up for an hour and I had to
talk to some one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve decided?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>His face was so tense, his voice so eager, that
it was as much as she could do to remain vexed.
Still, she resented the fact that he had spoken
to her aunt without authority. It was a presumption
that seemed to take for granted her
answer. It was as though he thought only one
answer possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heart of me,&#8221; he burst out, &#8220;you&#8217;ve decided?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you had no right to tell her,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down the road a bit,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>He led her down the path and along the
country road between fields wet with dew. The
air was clean and sweet and the sky overhead
a spotless blue. It was the freshest and cleanest
world he had ever seen and she was one with it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I only told her what she already knew,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knew?&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke in a lower voice&ndash;&ndash;a voice gentle
and trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said you came in last night after she
had gone asleep&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sally covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;she&ndash;&ndash;she told you
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached up and gently removed her
hands. He held them tight in both of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good of you to think of me like
that. It was like you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All the while he was drawing her nearer
and nearer to him. She resisted. At least she
thought she was resisting, but it didn&#8217;t seem
to make any difference. Nearer his eyes came
to hers; nearer his lips came to hers. She gave
a quick gasp as one before sudden danger.
Then she felt his warm lips against hers and
swayed slightly. But his arms were about her.
They were strong about her, so that, while
she felt as though hanging dizzily over a precipice,
she at the same moment never felt safer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
in her life. With his lips against her lips, she
closed her eyes until, to keep from losing herself
completely, she broke free. Her cheeks
scarlet, her breath coming short, her eyes like
stars, she stared at him a moment, and then
like a startled fawn turned and ran for the
house. He followed, but her feet were tipped
with wings. He did not catch her until she
had burst into the kitchen, where in some fear
Mrs. Halliday gathered her into her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t answered me even yet,&#8221; he explained
to Mrs. Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don,&#8221; cried the trembling girl, her
voice smothered in Mrs. Halliday&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;You dare say that after&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after what?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Halliday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>BARTON APPEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>The details of the wedding Mrs. Halliday decided
to take over into her own hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You two can just leave that to me,&#8221; she
informed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; protested Don, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see why we need bother with a lot of fuss
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business is this of yours?&#8221; Mrs.
Halliday challenged him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only we haven&#8217;t much time,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be time enough for Sally
to be married properly,&#8221; she decided.</p>
<p>That was all there was to it. It seems that
tucked away up in the attic there was an old
trunk and tucked away in that a wedding
dress of white silk which had been worn by
Sally&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been kept ag&#8217;in&#8217; this very day,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Halliday, &#8220;though I will say that
I was beginnin&#8217; to git discouraged.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>The dress was brought out, and no more
auspicious omen could have been furnished
Mrs. Halliday than the fact that, except in
several unimportant details, Sally could have
put it on and worn it, just as it was. Not only
did it fit, but the intervening years had brought
back into style again the very mode in which
it had been designed, so that, had she gone to a
Fifth Avenue dressmaker, she could have found
nothing more in fashion. Thus it was possible
to set the wedding date just four days off, for
Saturday. That was not one moment more of
time than Mrs. Halliday needed in which to
put the house in order&ndash;&ndash;even with the hearty
co&ouml;peration of Don, who insisted upon doing
his part, which included the washing of all the
upper windows.</p>
<p>Those were wonderful days for him. For
one thing he discovered that not only had
there been given into his keeping the clear-seeing,
steady-nerved, level-headed woman
who had filled so large a share of his life this
last year, but also another, who at first startled
him like some wood nymph leaping into
his path. She was so young, so vibrant with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
life, so quick with her smiles and laughter&ndash;&ndash;this
other. It was the girl in her, long suppressed,
because in the life she had been leading
in town there had been no playground. Her
whole attention there had been given to the
subjection of the wild impulses in which she
now indulged. She laughed, she ran, she reveled
in being just her care-free, girlish self.
Don watched her with a new thrill. He felt as
though she were taking him back to her early
youth&ndash;&ndash;as though she were filling up for him
all those years of her he had missed.</p>
<p>At night, about the usual time he was dining
in town, Mrs. Halliday insisted that Sally
should go to bed, as she herself did, which, of
course, left Don no alternative but to go himself.
There was no possible object in his remaining
up after Sally was out of sight. But
the early morning belonged to her and to him.
At dawn he rose and when he came downstairs,
he found her waiting for him. Though Mrs.
Halliday protested that Sally was losing her
beauty sleep she was not able to produce any
evidence to prove it. If any one could look
any fresher or more wonderful than Sally, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
she stepped out of the house by his side into
the light of the newborn day, then there was
no sense in it, because, as she was then, she
filled his eyes and his heart to overflowing.
She wore no hat, but except for this detail he
was never conscious of how she was dressed.
There was always too much to occupy him in
her brown eyes, in her mouth, which, while
losing nothing of its firmness, had acquired a
new gentleness. He had always thought of her
lips as cold, but he knew them better now. At
the bend in the road where he had kissed her
first, he kissed her again every morning. She
always protested. That was instinctive. But
in the end she submitted, because it always
seemed so many hours since she had seen him
last, and because she made him understand
that not until the next day could he expect
this privilege.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of being engaged if I can&#8217;t
kiss you as often as I wish?&#8221; he demanded
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re engaged in order to be married,&#8221;
she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after we are married&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You wait and see,&#8221; she answered, her
cheeks as red as any schoolgirl&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s three days off,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>Even to her, happy as she was, confident as
she was, the interval to Saturday sometimes
seemed like a very long space of time. For one
thing, she felt herself at night in the grip of a
kind of foreboding absolutely foreign to her.
Perhaps it was a natural reaction from the high
tension of the day, but at night she sometimes
found herself starting to her elbow in an agony
of fear. Before the day came, something would
happen to Don, because such happiness as
this was not meant for her. She fell a victim
to all manner of wild fears and extravagant
fancies. On the second night there was a
heavy thunderstorm. She did not mind such
things ordinarily. The majesty of the darting
light and the rolling crash of the thunder always
thrilled her. But this evening the sky was
blotted out utterly and quick light shot from
every point of the compass at once. As peal
followed peal, the house shook. Even then it
was not of herself she thought. She had no
fear except for Don. This might be the explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
of her foreboding. It happened, too,
that his room was beneath the big chimney
where if the house were hit the bolt would be
most apt to strike. Dressing hastily in her
wrapper and bedroom slippers, she stole into
the hall. A particularly vicious flash illuminated
the house for a second and then plunged
it into darkness. She crept to Don&#8217;s very door.
There she crouched, resolved that the same
bolt should kill them both. There she remained,
scarcely daring to breathe until the
shower passed.</p>
<p>It was a silly thing to do. When she came
back to her own room, her cheeks were burning
with shame. The next morning she was
miserable in fear lest he discover her weakness.
He did not, though he marveled at a new tenderness
in her that had been born in the night.</p>
<p>The fourth day broke fair and Don found
himself busy until noon helping with the
decorations of green and of wild flowers; for
though only a dozen or so neighbors had been
asked, Mrs. Halliday was thorough in whatever
she undertook. Had she been expecting a
hundred she could have done no more in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
way of preparation except perhaps to increase
the quantity of cake and ices.</p>
<p>Don himself had asked no one except old
Barton, of Barton &amp; Saltonstall, and him he
did not expect, although he had received no
reply to his invitation. What, then, was his
surprise when toward the middle of the forenoon,
as he was going into the house with an
armful of pine boughs, he heard a voice behind
him,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning, he saw Barton in a frock coat and
a tall hat that he might have worn last at
Pendleton, Senior&#8217;s, wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; exclaimed Don,
dropping his pine boughs on the doorstep and
rushing to meet him. &#8220;I call this mighty good
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could hardly do less for Pendleton&#8217;s boy,&#8221;
answered Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, you&#8217;re mighty welcome. Come
right in. Oh, Sally,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>Sally came on the run, not knowing what
had happened. She wore a calico apron and
had not found time to do her hair since morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
It was not exactly the costume she would
have chosen in which first to meet Mr. Barton.
Her cheeks showed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally,&#8221; said Don, &#8220;this is Mr. Barton&ndash;&ndash;my
father&#8217;s lawyer. Mr. Barton, this is Miss
Winthrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barton bowed low with old-fashioned courtesy.
Then he allowed his keen gray eyes to
rest a moment upon hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to meet you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
the house is very much in disorder just now,
but I want you to meet my aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday was scarcely more presentable
than Miss Winthrop, but the latter found
a certain relief in that fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to know you,&#8221; Mrs. Halliday
greeted him cordially.</p>
<p>But what to do with him at just this time
was a problem which would have baffled her
had he not solved it for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t let me interrupt the preparations,&#8221;
he begged. &#8220;I should not have ventured
here&ndash;&ndash;at just this time&ndash;&ndash;except that I
wanted to see Don about a few legal matters.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barton,&#8221; explained Don to Sally, &#8220;is
the man who had the pleasant duty thrust
upon him of telling me that I was cut off without
a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an unpleasant duty,&#8221; nodded Barton,
&#8220;but I hope it may be my good fortune
to make up for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the only place you can sit is on
the front doorstep,&#8221; laughed Sally.</p>
<p>&#8220;As good a place as any,&#8221; answered Don,
leading the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Don good-naturedly as soon
as they were seated there, &#8220;what&#8217;s the trouble
now? I tell you right off it&#8217;s got to be
something mighty serious to jar me any at just
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was still another codicil to your
father&#8217;s will,&#8221; explained Barton at once&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a
codicil I have not been at liberty to read to
you until now. It had, in fact, no point except
in the contingency of your marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you aren&#8217;t going to take the house
away from me,&#8221; scowled Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Barton slowly. &#8220;It has to
do rather with an additional provision. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
substance of it is that in case you married any
one&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;meeting with my approval, you
were to be given an allowance of two thousand
a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand a year. After that, one
thousand a year additional for each child
born of that marriage until the total allowance
amounts to five thousand dollars. At that
point the principal itself is to be turned over to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sally!&#8221; called Don.</p>
<p>She came running again. It was still four
hours before they would be safely married and
many things might happen in four hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down here and listen to this,&#8221; he commanded.
&#8220;Now, do you mind saying that all
over again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barton repeated his statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; inquired Don.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just as though I had my salary raised two
thousand a year. Not only that&ndash;&ndash;but the
rest is up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And besides,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;Mr. Barton
has not yet said he approves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Barton arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I say that at once?&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;I do
not think I have always given Don as much
credit for his good judgment as I feel he should
have been given.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Barton!&#8221; choked Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing more,&#8221; said Barton&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a&ndash;&ndash;a
little present for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He handed Don an envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Don, thrusting it
unopened in his pocket. &#8220;And now it seems
to me the least the bride can do is to let you
kiss her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a bride yet,&#8221; answered Sally demurely,
&#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She came to Barton&#8217;s side and he kissed her
on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad that Pendleton couldn&#8217;t have
lived to know his son&#8217;s wife,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A little later Don gave Sally the envelope
to open. It contained a check for five hundred
dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Don, &#8220;we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
rolling in wealth. I guess when we get back
to town we&#8217;ll have to buy a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we get back to town we&#8217;ll open a
bank account,&#8221; corrected Sally.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>A BULLY WORLD</h3>
</div>
<p>As Sally came down the stairs at a quarter of
three in her white silk wedding gown the wonder
was how, after a morning of such honest
hard work as she had put in, it was possible
for her to look so fresh. Many a town bride,
after spending the entire morning resting in
preparation for such an event, has at the last
moment failed to turn up with such apple-red
cheeks or brilliant eyes. There was a gently
serious expression about her mouth, to be
sure, but that was not due to fatigue. In spite
of her light-heartedness during the last few
days she had been all the while keenly conscious
that she was accepting a great responsibility.
She was about to marry not only a
lover, but a man whose future was to be in her
keeping. Among other things he was to be a
future partner in the firm of Carter, Rand &amp;
Seagraves, and that meant several years of
very hard work ahead of them. Then there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
were the secret responsibilities&ndash;&ndash;the unborn
responsibilities. These were not very definite,
to be sure, but she felt them, timidly, gravely,
in queer little tuggings at her heart.</p>
<p>When finally she stood in front of the clergyman
with Don by her side, she felt, not that
she was in a bower of wild flowers, but before
an altar. The ritual for her had a deeply religious
significance. She made her responses in
a steady voice heard by every one in the room.
When she made the promise &#8220;to love, cherish,
and obey,&#8221; she spoke it as though she meant
it. It did not disturb her in the slightest to
utter the word &#8220;obey,&#8221; because she knew well
that whatever commands came to her from
Don would be of her own inspiring. To her
this promise was no more than an agreement
to obey her own best impulses.</p>
<p>The service seemed almost too brief for so
solemn an undertaking, but when it was over,
she reached for Don&#8217;s hand and took it in a
hearty grip that was more of a pledge than the
ring itself. It sent a tingle to his heart and
made his lips come together&ndash;&ndash;the effect, a
hundred times magnified, of the coach&#8217;s slap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
upon the back that used to thrill him just before
he trotted on the field before a big game.
He felt that the harder the obstacles to be
overcome for her dear sake, the better. He
would like to have had a few at that moment as
a relief to his pent-up emotions.</p>
<p>He remembered in a sort of impatient daze
the congratulations that followed&ndash;&ndash;with the
faces of Mrs. Halliday and Barton standing
out a trifle more prominently&ndash;&ndash;and then the
luncheon. It seemed another week before she
went upstairs to change into her traveling-dress;
another week before she reappeared.
Then came good-byes and the shower of rice,
with an old shoe or so mixed in. He had sent
her trunk the day before to the mountain
hotel where they were to be for a week, but
they walked to the station, he carrying her
suitcase. Then he found himself on the train,
and in another two hours they were at the
hotel. It was like an impossible dream come
true when finally they stood for the first time
alone&ndash;&ndash;she as his wife. He held out his arms
to her and she came this time without protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heart of mine,&#8221; he whispered as he kissed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
her lips again and again,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;heart of mine,
this is a bully old world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made it that, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? I haven&#8217;t had anything to do about it
except to get you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>DON MAKES GOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>They had not one honeymoon, but two or
three. When they left the hotel and came back
to town, it was another honeymoon to enter
together the house in which she had played so
important a part without ever having seen it.
When they stepped out of the cab she insisted
upon first seeing it from the outside, instead
of rushing up the steps as he was for doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want
to have such a pleasure over with all at once.
I want to get it bit by bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not much to see, to be sure, but a
door and a few windows&ndash;&ndash;a section similar to
sections to the right and left of which it was a
part. But it was a whole house, a house with
lower stories and upper stories and a roof&ndash;&ndash;all
his, all hers. To her there was something
still unreal about it.</p>
<p>He humored her delay, though Nora was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
standing impatiently at the door, anxious to
see the Pendleton bride. But when she finally
did enter, Nora, at the smile she received, had
whatever fears might have been hers instantly
allayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd bless ye,&#8221; she beamed.</p>
<p>Sally refused to remove her wraps until she
had made her inspection room by room, sitting
down in each until she had grasped every detail.
So they went from the first floor to the
top floor and came back to the room which
he had set apart for their room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it suit you, wife of mine?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>With the joy of it all, her eyes filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s even more beautiful than I thought it
would be,&#8221; she trembled.</p>
<p>For him the house had changed the moment
she stepped into it. With his father alive, it had
been his father&#8217;s home rather than his; with his
father gone, it had been scarcely more than a
convenient resting-place. There had been moments&ndash;&ndash;when
he thought of Frances here&ndash;&ndash;that
it had taken on more significance, but even
this had been due to Sally. When he thought
he was making the house ready for another,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
it had been her dear hand who had guided him.
How vividly now he recalled that dinner at
the little French restaurant when he had described
his home to her&ndash;&ndash;the home which was
now her home too. It was at that moment she
had first made her personality felt here.</p>
<p>Sally removed her hat and tidied her hair
before the mirror in quite as matter-of-fact a
fashion as though she had been living here
ever since that day instead of only the matter
of a few minutes. When she came downstairs,
Nora herself seemed to accept her on that
basis. To her suggestions, she replied, &#8220;Yes,
Mrs. Pendleton,&#8221; as glibly as though she had
been saying it all her life.</p>
<p>They returned on a Saturday. On Monday
Don was to go back to the office. Sally had
sent in her resignation the day of her marriage
and had received nice letters from both Carter
and Farnsworth, with a check enclosed from
the former for fifty dollars and from the latter
for twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ll have to do,&#8221; said Don, as he retired
Sunday night, &#8220;is to get a larger alarm-clock.
It won&#8217;t do to be late any more.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Sally. &#8220;But you
won&#8217;t need an alarm-clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sally was awake at six the next morning and
Don himself less than one minute after.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to get up,&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sleepy,&#8221; murmured Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then to-morrow night you&#8217;ll get to bed
one hour earlier. But&ndash;&ndash;up with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o,&#8221; he answered as he sprang from
bed. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no need of your getting up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be ashamed of myself if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had breakfast with him that first work
morning as she planned to do every morning
of her life after that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Don,&#8221; she warned as he was ready
to leave, &#8220;mind you don&#8217;t say anything about
a raise in salary for a little while yet. I know
Farnsworth, and he&#8217;ll give it to you the moment
he feels you&#8217;ve made good. Besides, we
can afford to wait and&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know as I
want you to have any more money than you
have now. It&#8217;s ridiculous for you to have that
two thousand from your father.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can use it, little woman,&#8221; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can save it,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;And, of
course, it&#8217;s pretty nice to have an emergency
fund, only it sort of takes half the fun out of
life to be so safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes half the worry with it, too,&#8221; he
reminded her.</p>
<p>She thought a moment. Then she kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s good for people to worry a bit,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already done your share,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to meet me for lunch
at twelve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it were twelve now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not to think of me again until
twelve comes&ndash;&ndash;not once. You&#8217;re to tend to
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She kissed him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took his arm and led him to the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
there&ndash;&ndash;where, for all he cared, the whole street
might have seen him&ndash;&ndash;he turned quickly and
kissed her once more.</p>
<p>Don was decidedly self-conscious when he
stepped briskly into the office of Carter, Rand
&amp; Seagraves, with a brave attempt to give the
impression that nothing whatever out of the
ordinary had happened to him during his brief
vacation. But Blake, as he expressed it to her
later, was there with bells on. He spied him
the moment he came through the door and
greeted him with a whistled bar from the
&#8220;Wedding March.&#8221; Not content with that,
he tore several sheets of office stationery into
small bits and sprinkled him with it. He
seemed to take it as more or less of a joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly put one over on us,&#8221; exclaimed
Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it go at that,&#8221; Don frowned.</p>
<p>He was willing to take the horse-play, but
there was something in the spirit with which
it was done that he did not like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always heard bridegrooms were a bit
touchy,&#8221; returned Blake.</p>
<p>Don stepped nearer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Touchy isn&#8217;t the word, Blake,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;proud comes nearer it. Remember that I&#8217;m
proud as the devil of the girl you used to see
here. Just base your future attitude toward
her and me on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Farnsworth restored
his good humor. As he came into the private
office, Farnsworth rose and extended his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to congratulate you, Pendleton,&#8221;
he said sincerely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel almost as though we had lost a
partner in the firm,&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
mighty glad for both of you. She was fitted
for something a whole lot bigger than Wall
Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She taught me all I know about the game,&#8221;
confessed Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have had a better teacher.
Sit down. I want to talk over a change I have
in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don felt his heart leap to his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted for some time another man
to go out and sell,&#8221; said Farnsworth. &#8220;Do you
think you can handle it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; exclaimed Don.</p>
<p>Farnsworth smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; ran on Don in explanation, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been selling bonds to Sally&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Pendleton,
for a month or more now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imaginary bonds, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farnsworth threw back his head and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good! But the true test will come
when you try to sell her a real one. I&#8217;ll bet it
will have to be gilt-edged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And cheap,&#8221; nodded Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Farnsworth, &#8220;I want to try
you on the selling staff for a while, anyway.
Now, about salary&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally told me to forget that,&#8221; said Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess because she knew me well enough
to know I wouldn&#8217;t forget it. My intention
is to pay men in this office what they are worth.
Just what you may be worth in your new position
I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m going to advance
you five hundred; and if you make good you&#8217;ll
be paid in proportion as you make good. That
satisfactory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re off,&#8221; concluded Farnsworth.</p>
<p>Don met Sally at noon at the dairy lunch
where they had gone so often.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, little woman,&#8221; he greeted her.
&#8220;This place may be all right for the wife of a
clerk, but now you&#8217;re the wife of a bond salesman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On a five-hundred-dollar raise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay right here,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but I&#8217;m
going to celebrate by having two chocolate
&eacute;clairs.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HOME, JOHN&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>In December of the following year Frances
came into her mother&#8217;s room one afternoon,
drawing on her gloves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your new gown is very pretty,&#8221; her mother
said. &#8220;Where are you calling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have bridge at the Warrens&#8217; at four,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;But I thought I might have time
before that to drop in at Don&#8217;s. He has telephoned
me half a dozen times to call and see
his baby, and I suppose he&#8217;ll keep on until I
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really ought to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances became petulant. &#8220;Oh, I know it,
but&ndash;&ndash;after all, a baby <i>isn&#8217;t</i> interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They say it&#8217;s a pretty baby. It&#8217;s a boy,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Why don&#8217;t you come along
with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not dressed, dear, but please to extend
my congratulations.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>As John started to close the door of the limousine,
Frances glanced at her watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to call at Mr. Pendleton&#8217;s, but I
must be at the Warrens&#8217; at four promptly.
How much time must I allow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A half hour, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora took her card, and came back with the
request that she follow upstairs. &#8220;The baby&#8217;s
just waked up,&#8221; Nora said.</p>
<p>Frances was disappointed. If she had to see
a baby, she preferred, on the whole, seeing it
asleep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pendleton came to the nursery door
with the baby in her arms&ndash;&ndash;or rather a bundle
presumably containing a baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good of you to come,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I
think he must have waked up just to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke unaffectedly and with no trace of
embarrassment, although when Nora presented
the card she had for a second become confused.
She had hoped that Don would be at home
when this moment came.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s convenient for me to
stay?&#8221; questioned Frances uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; answered Mrs. Pendleton. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I
want you to see him when he&#8217;s good-natured.&#8221;</p>
<p>She crossed the room to the window, and
removed a layer of swaddling clothes very
gently. And there, revealed, lay Don, Jr. His
face was still rather red, and his nose pudgy;
but when he opened his eyes Frances saw Don&#8217;s
eyes. It gave her a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has his father&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; said the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt of that,&#8221; exclaimed
Frances.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his nose&ndash;&ndash;well, he hasn&#8217;t much of
any nose yet,&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems very small&ndash;&ndash;all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He weighed ten pounds this morning,&#8221;
said the mother.</p>
<p>Don, Jr., was waving his arms about, rather
feebly, but with determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very strong,&#8221; the mother informed
her. &#8220;Don declares that he has all the earmarks
of a football player.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed odd to hear this other speak so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
familiarly of Don. Frances glanced up quickly&ndash;&ndash;and
met Mrs. Pendleton&#8217;s eyes. It was as
if the two challenged each other. But Frances
was the first to turn away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to hold him a minute?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Pendleton.</p>
<p>Frances felt her breath coming fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d be clumsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold out your arms and I&#8217;ll put him in
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances held out her arms, and Mrs. Pendleton
gently laid the baby across them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hold him up to you,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Frances obeyed. The sweet, subtle aroma of
his hair reached her. The subtle warmth of his
body met hers. As the mystic eyes opened
below her eyes, a crooning lullaby hidden
somewhere within her found its way to her
throat and there stuck. She grew dizzy and
her throat ached. Don, Jr., moved uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to come back now,&#8221; said the
mother as she took him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; whispered Frances. &#8220;I may
come again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come often,&#8221; smiled Mrs. Pendleton.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>Frances tiptoed from the room, and tiptoed
all the way downstairs and through the hall.</p>
<p>As she stepped into the limousine, she said
to John: &#8220;Home, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you must be at the Warrens&#8217;
at four,&#8221; John respectfully reminded her.</p>
<p>She sank back wearily in the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home, John, please,&#8221; she repeated.</p>
